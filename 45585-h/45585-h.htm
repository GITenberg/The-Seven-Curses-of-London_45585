<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">STARTLING FACTS.</span></h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Pauper Population</i>.&mdash;<i>Pauper
Children</i>.&mdash;<i>Opinions concerning their proper
Treatment</i>.&mdash;<i>A Hundred Thousand Children loose in
London Streets</i>.&mdash;<i>Neglected
Babies</i>.&mdash;<i>Juvenile</i> &ldquo;<i>Market
Prowlers</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a startling fact that, in
England and Wales alone, at the present time, the number of
children under the age of sixteen, dependent more or less on the
parochial authorities for maintenance, amounts to three hundred
and fifty thousand.</p>
<p>It is scarcely less startling to learn that annually more than
a hundred thousand criminals emerge at the doors of the various
prisons, that, for short time or long time, have been their
homes, and with no more substantial advice than &ldquo;to take
care that they don&rsquo;t make their appearance there
again,&rdquo; are turned adrift once more to face the world,
unkind as when they last stole from it.&nbsp; This does not
include our immense army of juvenile vagrants.&nbsp; How the
information has been arrived at is more than I can tell; but it
is an accepted fact that, <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>daily, winter and summer, within the
limits of our vast and wealthy city of London, there wander,
destitute of proper guardianship, food, clothing, or employment,
a <i>hundred thousand</i> boys and girls in fair training for the
treadmill and the oakum shed, and finally for Portland and the
convict&rsquo;s mark.</p>
<p>It is these last-mentioned hundred thousand, rather than the
four hundred and fifty thousand previously mentioned, that are
properly classed under the heading of this first chapter.&nbsp;
Practically, the three hundred and fifty thousand little paupers
that cumber the poor-rates are without the category of neglected
ones.&nbsp; In all probability, at least one-half of that vast
number never were victims of neglect, in the true sense of the
term.&nbsp; Mr. Bumble derives his foster children from sources
innumerable.&nbsp; There are those that are born in the
&ldquo;house,&rdquo; and who, on some pretext, are abandoned by
their unnatural mother.&nbsp; There are the &ldquo;strays,&rdquo;
discovered by the police on their beats, and consigned, for the
present, to the workhouse, and never owned.&nbsp; There is the
offspring of the decamping weaver, or shoemaker, who goes on
tramp &ldquo;to better himself;&rdquo; but, never succeeding,
does not regard it as worth while to tramp home again to report
his ill-luck.&nbsp; These, and such as these, may truly ascribe
their pauperism to neglect on somebody&rsquo;s part; but by far
the greater number are what they are through sheer
misfortune.&nbsp; When death snatches father away from the table
scarcely big enough to accommodate the little flock that cluster
about it&mdash;snatches him away in the lusty prime of <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>life, and
without warning, or, worse still, flings him on a bed of
sickness, the remedies for which devour the few pounds thriftily
laid aside for such an emergency, and, after all, are of no
avail, what other asylum but the workhouse offers itself to
mother and children?&nbsp; How many cases of this kind the parish
books could reveal, one can only guess; quite enough, we may be
sure, to render unpalatable that excessive amount of caution
observed by those in power against &ldquo;holding out a
premium&rdquo; to pauperism.&nbsp; It is somewhat amazing to hear
great authorities talk sometimes.&nbsp; Just lately, Mr. Bartley,
reading at the Society of Arts a paper entitled, &ldquo;The
training and education of pauper children,&rdquo; took occasion
to remark:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These children cannot be looked upon
exactly in the same way as paupers proper, inasmuch as their
unfortunate position is entirely due to circumstances over which
they could have no control.&nbsp; They are either the offspring
of felons, cripples, and idiots, or orphans, bastards, and
deserted children, and claim the protection of the law,
frequently from their tenderest years, from having been deprived
of the care of their natural guardians without fault or crime of
their own.&nbsp; Such being their condition, they must either
steal or starve in the streets, or the State must take charge of
them.&nbsp; It may further be affirmed that, in a strictly
commercial point of view, it is more economical to devote a
certain amount in education and systematic training than by
allowing them to grow up in the example of their parents and
workhouse companions, to render their permanent support, either
in a prison or a <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>workhouse, a burden on the industrious classes.&nbsp; The
State, in fact, acknowledges this, and accordingly a provision is
theoretically supplied for all pauper children, not only for
their bodily wants, but, to a certain extent, for their mental
improvement.&nbsp; At the same time, it is also necessary that
the extreme should not be run into, viz., that of treating them
so liberally as to hold out a premium to pauperism.&nbsp; In no
case should their comfort be better than, nor in fact as good as,
an industrious labourer has within his reach.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bartley is a gentleman whose knowledge of the subject he
treats of exceeds that of most men; moreover, he is a man who, in
his acts and nature, shows himself actuated by a kind heart,
governed by a sound head; but, with all deference, it is
difficult to agree altogether with the foregoing remarks of his:
and they are the better worth noticing, because precisely the
same sentiment breathes through almost every modern, new, and
improved system of parochial reform.&nbsp; Why should these
unfortunate creatures, &ldquo;their unfortunate position being
entirely due to circumstances over which they had no
control,&rdquo; be made less comfortable in their condition than
the industrious labourer,&mdash;who, by the way, may be an
agricultural labourer, with his starvation wages of nine
shillings a week and his damp and miserable hovel of two rooms to
board and lodge his numerous family?&nbsp; What sort of justice
is it to keep constantly before their unoffending eyes the
humiliating fact that they have no standing even on the bottom
round of the social ladder, and that their proper place is to
crouch meekly and uncomplainingly <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>at the foot of it?&nbsp; Even
supposing that they, the pauper children, are &ldquo;either the
offspring of felons, cripples, and idiots, or orphans, bastards,
and deserted children,&rdquo; which is assuming to the verge of
improbability, still, since it is acknowledged that the state in
which we discover them &ldquo;is due to no fault or crime of
their own,&rdquo; why should we hesitate to make them commonly
comfortable?&nbsp; To fail so to do when it is in our power, and
when, according to their innocence and helplessness, it is their
due, is decidedly at variance with the commonly-understood
principles of Christian charity.&nbsp; It will be needless,
however, here to pursue the subject of pauper management, since
another section of this book has been given to its
consideration.&nbsp; Anyhow, our three hundred and fifty thousand
pauper children can have no claim to be reckoned among the
&ldquo;neglected.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are, or should be, a class
whose hard necessity has been brought under the notice of the
authorities, and by them considered and provided for.</p>
<p>There are other neglected children besides those already
enumerated, and who are not included in the tenth part of a
million who live in the streets, for the simple reason that they
are too young to know the use of their legs.&nbsp; They are
&ldquo;coming on,&rdquo; however.&nbsp; There is no present fear
of the noble annual crop of a hundred thousand diminishing.&nbsp;
They are so plentifully propagated that a savage preaching
&ldquo;civilization&rdquo; might regard it as a mercy that the
localities of their infant nurture are such as suit the ravening
appetites of cholera and typhus.&nbsp; Otherwise they would breed
like rabbits in an <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>undisturbed warren, and presently swarm so abundantly
that the highways would be over-run, making it necessary to pass
an Act of Parliament, improving on the latest enacted for dogs,
against the roaming at large of unmuzzled children of the
gutter.&nbsp; Observe the vast number of &ldquo;city
Arabs,&rdquo; to be encountered in a walk, from Cheapside to the
Angel at Islington, say.&nbsp; You cannot mistake them.&nbsp;
There are other children who are constantly encountered in the
street, male and female, who, though perhaps neither so ragged
and dirty as the genuine juvenile vagrants, are even more sickly
and hungry looking; but it is as easy to distinguish between the
two types&mdash;between the <i>home-owning</i> and the
<i>homeless</i>, as between the sleek pet dog, and the cur of the
street, whose ideas of a &ldquo;kennel&rdquo; are limited to that
represented by the wayside gutter, from which by good-luck
edibles may be extracted.&nbsp; Not only does the youthful
ragamuffin cry aloud for remedy in every street and public way of
the city, he thrusts his ugly presence on us continuously, and
appeals to us in bodily shape.&nbsp; In this respect, the curse
of neglected children differs widely from any of the others,
beggars alone excepted, perhaps.&nbsp; And even as regards
beggars, to see them is not always to believe in them as human
creatures helpless in the sad condition in which they are
discovered, and worthy of the best help we can afford to bestow
on them.&nbsp; It is next to impossible by outward signs merely
to discriminate between the impostor and the really unfortunate
and destitute.&nbsp; The pallid cheek and the sunken eye, may be
a work of art and not of nature, and in the <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>cunning
arrangement of rags, so as to make the most of them, the cheat
must always have an advantage over the genuine article.&nbsp;
Weighing the evidence <i>pro.</i> and <i>con.</i>, the object of
it creeping even at his snail&rsquo;s pace may be out of sight
before we arrive at what appears to us a righteous verdict, and
our scrupulous charity reserved for another, occasion.&nbsp; But
no such perplexing doubts and hesitation need trouble us in
selecting the boy gutter bred and born from the one who lays
claim to a home, even though it may be no more than a feeble
pretence, consisting of a family nightly gathering in some dirty
sty that serves as a bedroom, and a morning meeting at a board
spread with a substitute for a breakfast.&nbsp; In the latter
there is an expression of countenance utterly wanting in the
former; an undescribable shyness, and an instinctive observance
of decency, that has been rain-washed and sun-burnt out of the
gipsy of the London highway since the time of his crawling out of
the gooseberry sieve, with a wisp of hay in it that served him as
a cradle.</p>
<p>And here I can fancy I hear the incredulous reader exclaim,
&ldquo;But that is mere imagery of course; ragamuffin babies
never are cradled in gooseberry sieves, with a wisp of hay to lie
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me assure you, dear madam, it is not
imagery, but positive fact.&nbsp; The strangest receptacles do
duty as baby cradles at times.&nbsp; In another part of our book,
it will be shown that a raisin-box may be so adapted, or even an
egg-box; the latter with a bit of straw in it as a cradle for an
invalid baby with a broken thigh!&nbsp; But as regards the
gooseberry sieve, it is a fact that came under <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the
writer&rsquo;s immediate observation.&nbsp; Accompanied by a
friend, he was on a visit of exploration into the little-known
regions of Baldwin&rsquo;s Gardens, in Leather Lane, and entering
a cellar there, the family who occupied it were discovered in a
state of dreadful commotion.&nbsp; The mother, a tall, bony,
ragged shrew, had a baby tucked under one arm, while she was
using the other by the aid of a pair of dilapidated nozzleless
bellows in inflicting a tremendous beating on a howling young
gentleman of about eleven years old.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tut! tut! what
is the matter, Mrs. Donelly?&nbsp; Rest your arm a moment, now,
and tell us all about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Matther! shure
it&rsquo;s matther enough to dhrive a poor widdy beyant her
sinses!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then her rage turning to sorrow, she in
pathetic terms described how that she left that bad boy Johnny
only for a few moments in charge of the &ldquo;darlint
comfortable ashleap in her bashket,&rdquo; and that he had
neglected his duty, and that the baste of a donkey had smelt her
out, and &ldquo;ate her clane out o&rsquo; bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have had so much experience in this way, that one day I may
write a book on the Haunts and Homes of the British Baby.&nbsp;
It was not long after the incident of the gooseberry sieve, that
I discovered in one small room in which a family of six resided,
three little children, varying in age from three to eight,
perhaps, stark naked.&nbsp; It was noon of a summer&rsquo;s day,
and there they were nude as forest monkeys, and so hideously
dirty that every rib-bone in their poor wasted little bodies
showed plain, and in colour like mahogany.&nbsp; Soon as I put my
head in at the door they scattered, scared as rabbits, to the
&ldquo;bed,&rdquo; <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>an arrangement of evil-smelling flock and old
potato-sacks, and I was informed by the mother that they had not
a rag to wear, and had been in their present condition for
<i>more than three months</i>.</p>
<p>Let us return, however, to the hordes of small Arabs found
wandering about the streets of the city.&nbsp; To the mind of the
initiated, instantly recurs the question, &ldquo;whence do they
all come&rdquo;?&nbsp; They are not imported like those other
pests of society, &ldquo;German band boys or organ
grinders;&rdquo; they must have been babies once upon a time;
where did they grow up?&nbsp; In very dreary and retired regions,
my dear sir, though for that matter if it should happen that you
are perambulating fashionable Regent-street or aristocratic
Belgravia, when you put to yourself the perplexing question, you
may be nigher to a visible solution of the mystery than you would
care to know.&nbsp; Where does the shoeless, ragged, dauntless,
and often desperate boy of the gutter breed?&nbsp; Why, not
unfrequently as close almost to the mansions of the rich and
highly respectable as the sparrows in their chimney stacks.&nbsp;
Nothing is more common than to discover a hideous stew of courts
and alleys reeking in poverty and wretchedness almost in the
shadow of the palatial abodes of the great and wealthy.&nbsp;
Such instances might be quoted by the dozen.</p>
<p>It is seldom that these fledglings of the hawk tribe quit
their nests or rather their nesting places until they are
capable, although on a most limited scale, of doing business on
their own account.&nbsp; Occasionally a specimen may be seen in
the vicinity of Covent Garden or Farringdon <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Market,
seated on a carriage extemporized out of an old rusty teatray and
drawn along by his elder relatives, by means of a string.&nbsp;
It may not be safely assumed, however, that the latter are
actuated by no other than affectionate and disinterested motives
in thus treating their infant charge to a ride.&nbsp; It is much
more probable that being left at home in the alley by their
mother, who is engaged elsewhere at washing or
&ldquo;charing,&rdquo; with strict injunctions not to leave baby
for so long as a minute, and being goaded to desperation by the
thoughts of the plentiful feed of cast-out plums and oranges to
be picked up in &ldquo;Common Garden&rdquo; at this &ldquo;dead
ripe&rdquo; season of the year, they have hit on this ingenious
expedient by which the maternal mandate may be obeyed to the
letter, and their craving for market refuse be at the same time
gratified.</p>
<p>By-the-bye, it may here be mentioned as a contribution towards
solving the riddle, &ldquo;How do these hundred thousand street
prowlers contrive to exist?&rdquo; that they draw a considerable
amount of their sustenance from the markets.&nbsp; And really it
would seem that by some miraculous dispensation of Providence,
garbage was for their sake robbed of its poisonous properties,
and endowed with virtues such as wholesome food possesses.&nbsp;
Did the reader ever see the young market hunters at such a
&ldquo;feed&rdquo; say in the month of August or September?&nbsp;
It is a spectacle to be witnessed only by early risers who can
get as far as Covent Garden by the time that the wholesale
dealing in the open falls slack&mdash;which will be about eight
o&rsquo;clock; and it is not to be believed <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>unless it is
seen.&nbsp; They will gather about a muck heap and gobble up
plums, a sweltering mass of decay, and oranges and apples that
have quite lost their original shape and colour, with the avidity
of ducks or pigs.&nbsp; I speak according to my knowledge, for I
have seen them at it.&nbsp; I have seen one of these gaunt
wolfish little children with his tattered cap full of plums of a
sort one of which I would not have permitted a child of mine to
eat for all the money in the Mint, and this at a season when the
sanitary authorities in their desperate alarm at the spread of
cholera had turned bill stickers, and were begging and imploring
the people to abstain from this, that, and the other, and
especially to beware of fruit unless perfectly sound and
ripe.&nbsp; Judging from the earnestness with which this last
provision was urged, there must have been cholera enough to have
slain a dozen strong men in that little ragamuffin&rsquo;s cap,
and yet he munched on till that frowsy receptacle was emptied,
finally licking his fingers with a relish.&nbsp; It was not for
me to forcibly dispossess the boy of a prize that made him the
envy of his plumless companions, but I spoke to the market beadle
about it, asking him if it would not be possible, knowing the
propensities of these poor little wretches, so to dispose of the
poisonous offal that they could not get at it; but he replied
that it was nothing to do with him what they ate so long as they
kept their hands from picking and stealing; furthermore he
politely intimated that &ldquo;unless I had nothing better to
do&rdquo; there was no call for me to trouble myself about the
&ldquo;little warmint,&rdquo; whom nothing would hurt.&nbsp; He
confided to me his private belief that they were &ldquo;made
inside something after the orsestretch, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and that
farriers&rsquo; nails wouldn&rsquo;t come amiss to &rsquo;em if
they could only get &rsquo;em down.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, and
although the evidence was rather in the sagacious market
beadle&rsquo;s favour, I was unconverted from my original
opinion, and here take the liberty of urging on any official of
Covent Garden or Farringdon Market who may happen to read these
pages the policy of adopting my suggestion as to the safe
bestowal of fruit offal during the sickly season.&nbsp; That
great danger is incurred by allowing it to be consumed as it now
is, there cannot be a question.&nbsp; Perhaps it is too much to
assume that the poor little beings whom hunger prompts to feed
off garbage do so with impunity.&nbsp; It is not improbable that,
in many cases, they slink home to die in their holes as poisoned
rats do.&nbsp; That they are never missed from the market is no
proof of the contrary.&nbsp; Their identification is next to
impossible, for they are like each other as apples in a sieve, or
peas in one pod.&nbsp; Moreover, to tell their number is out of
the question.&nbsp; It is as incomprehensible as is their
nature.&nbsp; They swarm as bees do, and arduous indeed would be
the task of the individual who undertook to reckon up the small
fry of a single alley of the hundreds that abound in
Squalor&rsquo;s regions.&nbsp; They are of as small account in
the public estimation as stray street curs, and, like them, it is
only where they evince a propensity for barking and biting that
their existence is recognised.&nbsp; Should death to-morrow
morning make a clean sweep of the unsightly little scavengers who
grovel for a meal amongst the market offal heaps, next day would
see the said heaps just as industriously surrounded.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">RESPECTING THE PARENTAGE OF SOME OF OUR
GUTTER POPULATION.</span></h3>

Flashy</i>, <i>Flaunting</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Instructive</span> and interesting though
it may be to inquire into the haunts and habits of these wretched
waifs and &ldquo;rank outsiders&rdquo; of humanity, of how much
importance and of useful purpose is it to dig yet a little deeper
and discover who are the parents&mdash;the mothers
especially&mdash;of these babes of the gutter.</p>
<p>Clearly they had no business there at all.&nbsp; A human
creature, and more than all, a <i>helpless</i> human creature,
endowed with the noblest shape of God&rsquo;s creation, and with
a soul to save or lose, is as much out of place grovelling in
filth and contamination as would be a wild cat crouching on the
hearth-rug of a nursery.&nbsp; How come they there, then?&nbsp;
Although not bred absolutely in the kennel, many merge into life
so very near the edge of it, that it is no wonder if even their
infantine kickings and sprawlings are enough to topple them
over.&nbsp; Some there are, not vast in number, perhaps, but of a
character to influence the whole, who are dropped into the gutter
from such a height that they may never crawl out of it&mdash;<a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>they are so
sorely crippled.&nbsp; Others, again, find their way to the
gutter by means of a process identical with that which serves the
conveyance to sinks and hidden sewers of the city&rsquo;s
ordinary refuse and off-scourings.&nbsp; Of this last-mentioned
sort, however, it will be necessary to treat at length
presently.</p>
<p>I think that it may be taken as granted that gross and
deliberate immorality is not mainly responsible for our gutter
population.&nbsp; Neither can the poverty of the nation be justly
called on to answer for it.&nbsp; On the contrary, unless I am
greatly mistaken, the main tributary to the foul stream has its
fountain-head in the keen-witted, ready-penny commercial
enterprise of the small-capital, business-minded portion of our
vast community.</p>
<p>In no respect are we so unlike our forefathers as in our
struggles after &ldquo;mastership&rdquo; in business, however
petty.&nbsp; This may be a sign of commercial progress amongst
us, but it is doubtful if it tends very much to the healthful
constitution of our humanity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Work hard and win a
fortune,&rdquo; has become a dry and mouldy maxim, distasteful to
modern traders, and has yielded to one that is much smarter,
viz., &ldquo;There is more got by scheming than by hard
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By scheming the labour of others, that is; little
children&mdash;anyone.&nbsp; It is in the infant labour market
especially that this new and dashing spirit of commercial
enterprise exercises itself chiefly.&nbsp; There are many kinds
of labour that require no application of muscular strength; all
that is requisite is dexterity and lightness of touch, and these
with most children are natural gifts.&nbsp; They <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>are better
fitted for the work they are set to than adults would be, while
the latter would require as wages shillings where the little ones
are content with pence.&nbsp; This, perhaps, would be tolerable
if their earnings increased with their years; but such an
arrangement does not come within the scheme of the sweaters and
slop-factors, Jew and Christian, who grind the bones of little
children to make them not only bread, but luxurious living and
country houses, and carriages to ride in.&nbsp; When their
&ldquo;hands&rdquo; cease to be children, these enterprising
tradesmen no longer require their services, and they are
discharged to make room for a new batch of small toilers, eager
to engage themselves on terms that the others have learned to
despise, while those last-mentioned unfortunates are cast adrift
to win their bread&mdash;somehow.</p>
<p>Anyone curious to know the sort of working young female
alluded to may be gratified a hundred times over any day of the
week, if he will take the trouble to post himself, between the
hours of twelve and two, at the foot of London or Blackfriars
bridge.&nbsp; There he will see the young girl of the slop-shop
and the city &ldquo;warehouse&rdquo; hurrying homeward on the
chance of finding a meagre makeshift&mdash;&ldquo;something
hot&rdquo;&mdash;that may serve as a dinner.</p>
<p>It is a sight well worth the seeking of any philanthropic
person interested in the present condition and possible future of
the infant labour market.&nbsp; How much or how little of truth
there may be in the lament one occasionally hears, that our
endurance is failing us, and that we seldom reach the ripe old
age attained by our ancestors, we will not here discuss; at least
there can <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>be no doubt of this&mdash;that we grow old much earlier
than did our great grandfathers; and though our
&ldquo;three-score years and ten&rdquo; may be shortened by
fifteen or twenty years, the downhill portion of our existence is
at least as protracted as that of the hale men of old who could
leap a gate at sixty.&nbsp; This must be so, otherwise the
ancient law, defining an infant as &ldquo;a person under the age
of fourteen,&rdquo; could never have received the sanction of
legislators.&nbsp; Make note of these &ldquo;infants&rdquo; of
the law as they come in knots of two and three, and sometimes in
an unbroken &ldquo;gang,&rdquo; just as they left the factory,
putting their best feet foremost in a match against time; for all
that is allowed them is one hour, and within that limited period
they have to walk perhaps a couple of miles to and fro, resting
only during that brief space in which it is their happy privilege
to exercise their organs of mastication.</p>
<p>Good times indeed were those olden ones, if for no other
reason than that they knew not such infants as these!&nbsp; Of
the same stuff in the main, one and all, but by no means of the
same pattern.&nbsp; Haggard, weary-eyed infants, who never could
have been babies; little slips of things, whose heads are
scarcely above the belt of the burly policeman lounging out his
hours of duty on the bridge, but who have a brow on which, in
lines indelible, are scored a dreary account of the world&rsquo;s
hard dealings with them.&nbsp; Painfully puckered mouths have
these, and an air of such sad, sage experience, that one might
fancy, not that these were young people who would one day grow to
be old women, but rather that, by some <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>inversion of the natural order of
things, they had once been old and were growing young
again&mdash;that they had seen seventy, at least, but had doubled
on the brow of the hill of age, instead of crossing it, and
retraced their steps, until they arrived back again at thirteen;
the old, old heads planted on the young shoulders revealing the
secret.</p>
<p>This, the most melancholy type of the grown-up neglected
infant, is, however, by no means the most painful of those that
come trooping past in such a mighty hurry.&nbsp; Some are dogged
and sullen-looking, and appear as though steeped to numbness in
the comfortless doctrine, &ldquo;What can&rsquo;t be cured must
be endured;&rdquo; as if they had acquired a certain sort of
surly relish for the sours of existence, and partook of them as a
matter of course, without even a wry face.&nbsp; These are not of
the sort that excite our compassion the most; neither are the
ailing and sickly-looking little girls, whose tender
constitutions have broken down under pressure of the poison
inhaled in the crowded workroom, and long hours, and countless
trudgings, early and late, in the rain and mire, with no better
covering for their shoulders than a flimsy mantle a shower would
wet through and through, and a wretched pair of old boots that
squelch on the pavement as they walk.&nbsp; Pitiful as are these
forlorn ones to behold, there is, at least, a grim satisfaction
in knowing that with them it cannot last.&nbsp; The creature who
causes us most alarm is a girl of a very different type.</p>
<p>This is the flashy, flaunting &ldquo;infant,&rdquo; barely
fourteen, and with scarce four feet of stature, but
self-possessed and <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>bold-eyed enough to be a &ldquo;daughter of the
regiment&rdquo;&mdash;of a militia regiment even.&nbsp; She
consorts with birds of her own feather.&nbsp; Very little
experience enables one to tell at a glance almost how these girls
are employed, and it is quite evident that the terrible infant in
question and her companions are engaged in the manufacture of
artificial flowers.&nbsp; Their teeth are discoloured, and there
is a chafed and chilblainish appearance about their nostrils, as
though suffering under a malady that were best consoled with a
pocket-handkerchief.&nbsp; The symptoms in question, however, are
caused by the poison used in their work&mdash;arsenite of copper,
probably, that deadly mineral being of a &ldquo;lovely
green,&rdquo; and much in favour amongst artificial florists and
their customers.&nbsp; Here they come, unabashed by the throng,
as though the highway were their home, and all mankind their
brothers; she, the heroine with a bold story to tell, and plenty
of laughter and free gesticulation as sauce with it.&nbsp; She is
of the sort, and, God help them! they may be counted by hundreds
in London alone, in whom keen wit would appear to be developed
simultaneously with ability to walk and talk.&nbsp; Properly
trained, these are the girls that grow to be clever, capable
women&mdash;women of spirit and courage and shrewd
discernment.&nbsp; The worst of it is that the seed implanted
will germinate.&nbsp; Hunger cannot starve it to death, or
penurious frosts destroy it.&nbsp; Untrained, it grows apace,
overturning and strangling all opposition and asserting its
paramount importance.</p>
<p>This is the girl who is the bane and curse of the workroom
crowded with juvenile stitchers or pasters, or <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>workers in
flowers or beads.&nbsp; Her constant assumption of
lightheartedness draws them towards her, her lively stories are a
relief from the monotonous drudgery they are engaged on.&nbsp;
Old and bold in petty wickedness, and with audacious pretensions
to acquaintance with vice of a graver sort, she entertains them
with stories of &ldquo;sprees&rdquo; and &ldquo;larks&rdquo; she
and her friends have indulged in.&nbsp; She has been to
&ldquo;plays&rdquo; and to &ldquo;dancing rooms,&rdquo; and to
the best of her ability and means she demonstrates the latest
fashion in her own attire, and wears her draggletail flinders of
lace and ribbon in such an easy and old-fashionable manner, poor
little wretch, as to impress one with the conviction that she
must have been used to this sort of thing since the time of her
shortcoating; which must have been many, many years ago.&nbsp;
She has money to spend; not much, but sufficient for the purchase
of luxuries, the consumption of which inflict cruel pangs on the
hungry-eyed beholders.&nbsp; She is a person whose intimacy is
worth cultivating, and they do cultivate it, with what result
need not be here described.</p>
<p>At fifteen the London factory-bred girl in her vulgar way has
the worldly knowledge of the ordinary female of eighteen or
twenty.&nbsp; She has her &ldquo;young man,&rdquo; and
accompanies him of evenings to &ldquo;sing-songs&rdquo; and
raffles, and on high days and holidays to Hampton by the shilling
van, or to Greenwich by the sixpenny boat.&nbsp; At sixteen she
wearies of the frivolities of sweethearting, and the young man
being agreeable the pair embark in housekeeping, and
&ldquo;settle down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps they marry, and be it distinctly understood, <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>whatever has
been said to the contrary, the estate of matrimony amongst her
class is not lightly esteemed.&nbsp; On the contrary, it is a
contract in which so much pride is taken that the certificate
attesting its due performance is not uncommonly displayed on the
wall of the living-room as a choice print or picture might be;
with this singular and unaccountable distinction that when a
<i>clock</i> is reckoned with the other household furniture, the
marriage certificate is almost invariably hung under it.&nbsp; It
was Mr. Catlin of the Cow Cross Mission who first drew my
attention to this strange observance, and in our many
explorations into the horrible courts and alleys in the vicinity
of his mission-house he frequently pointed out instances of this
strange custom; but even he, who is as learned in the habits and
customs of all manner of outcasts of civilisation as any man
living, was unable to explain its origin.&nbsp; When questioned
on the subject the common answer was, &ldquo;They say that
it&rsquo;s lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is the expense attending the process that makes matrimony
the exception and not the rule amongst these people.&nbsp; At
least this is their invariable excuse.&nbsp; And here, as bearing
directly on the question of &ldquo;neglected infants,&rdquo; I
may make mention of a practice that certain well-intentioned
people are adopting with a view to diminishing the prevalent sin
of the unmarried sexes herding in their haunts of poverty, and
living together as man and wife.</p>
<p>The said practice appears sound enough on the surface.&nbsp;
It consists simply in marrying these erring couples gratis.&nbsp;
The missionary or scripture reader of the district <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>who, as a
rule, is curiously intimate with the family affairs of his flock,
calls privately on those young people whose clock, if they have
one, ticks to a barren wall, and makes the tempting
offer&mdash;banns put up, service performed, beadle and pew
opener satisfied, and all free!&nbsp; As will not uncommonly
happen, if driven into a corner for an excuse, the want of a
jacket or a gown &ldquo;to make a &rsquo;spectable
&rsquo;pearance in&rdquo; is pleaded; the negociator makes a note
of it, and in all probability the difficulty is provided against,
and in due course the marriage is consummated.</p>
<p>This is all very well as far as it goes, but to my way of
thinking the scheme is open to many grave objections.&nbsp; In
the first place the instinct that incites people to herd like
cattle in a lair is scarcely the same as induces them to blend
their fortunes and live &ldquo;for better, for worse&rdquo; till
the end of their life.&nbsp; It requires no great depth of
affection on the man&rsquo;s part to lead him to take up with a
woman who, in consideration of board and lodging and masculine
protection will create some semblance of a home for him.&nbsp; In
his selection of such a woman he is not governed by those grave
considerations that undoubtedly present themselves to his mind
when he meditates wedding himself irrevocably to a mate.&nbsp;
Her history, previous to his taking up with her, may be known to
him, and though perhaps not all that he could wish, she is as
good to him as she promised to be, and they get along pretty well
and don&rsquo;t quarrel very much.</p>
<p>Now, although not one word can be urged in favour of this
iniquitous and shocking arrangement, is it quite <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>certain that
a great good is achieved by inducing such a couple to tie
themselves together in the sacred bonds of matrimony?&nbsp; It is
not a marriage of choice as all marriages should be.&nbsp; If the
pair had been bent on church marriage and earnestly desired it,
it is absurd to suppose that the few necessary shillings, the
price of its performance, would have deterred them.&nbsp; If they
held the sacred ceremony of so small account as to regard it as
well dispensed with as adopted, it is no very great triumph of
the cause of religion and morality that the balance is decided by
a gown or a jacket, in addition to the good will of the
missionary (who, by-the-bye, is generally the distributor of the
alms of the charitable) being thrown into the scale.</p>
<p>To be sure the man is not compelled to yield to the
persuasions of those who would make of him a creditable member of
society; he is not compelled to it, but he can hardly be regarded
as a free agent.&nbsp; If the pair have children already, the
woman will be only too anxious to second the solicitation of her
friend, and so secure to herself legal protection in addition to
that that is already secured to her through her mate&rsquo;s
acquired regard for her.&nbsp; Then it is so difficult to combat
the simple question, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; when all is so
generously arranged&mdash;even to the providing a real gold ring
to be worn in place of the common brass make-believe&mdash;and
nothing remains but to step round to the parish church, where the
minister is waiting, and where in a quarter of an hour, the
great, and good, and lasting work may be accomplished.&nbsp; The
well-meaning missionary asks, &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
woman, <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>urged by moral or mercenary motives, echoes the
momentous query, and both stand with arms presented, in a manner
of speaking, to hear the wavering one&rsquo;s objection.&nbsp;
The wavering one is not generally of the far-seeing sort.&nbsp;
In his heart he does not care as much as a shilling which way it
is.&nbsp; He does not in the least trouble himself from the
religious and moral point of view.&nbsp; When his adviser says,
&ldquo;Just consider how much easier your conscience will be if
you do this act of justice to the woman whom you have selected as
your helpmate,&rdquo; he wags his head as though admitting it,
but having no conscience about the matter he is not very deeply
impressed.&nbsp; Nine times out of ten the summing-up of his
deliberation is, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care; it won&rsquo;t cost
<i>me</i> nothing; let &rsquo;em have their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what, probably, is the upshot of the good
missionary&rsquo;s endeavours and triumph?&nbsp; In a very little
time the gilt with which the honest adviser glossed the chain
that was to bind the man irrevocably to marriage and morality
wears off.&nbsp; The sweat of his brow will not keep it bright;
it rusts it.&nbsp; He feels, in his own vulgar though expressive
language, that he has been &ldquo;bustled&rdquo; into a bad
bargain.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is like this &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; a
matrimonial victim of the class once confided to me; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t say as she isn&rsquo;t as good as ever, but I&rsquo;m
blowed if she&rsquo;s all that better as I was kidded to believe
she would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if she is as good as ever, she is good
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you haven&rsquo;t quite got the bearing of
what I mean, sir, and I haint got it in me to put it in the words
like you would.&nbsp; Good enough before isn&rsquo;t good enough
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>now, cos
it haint hoptional, don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; No, you
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well, look here.&nbsp; S&rsquo;pose I borrer a
barrer.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s good enough and a conwenient size
for laying out my stock on it.&nbsp; It goes pooty easy, and I
pays eighteen pence a week for it and I&rsquo;m satisfied.&nbsp;
Well, I goes on all right and without grumbling, till some chap
he ses to me, &lsquo;What call have you got to borrer a barrer
when you can have one of your own; you alwis <i>want</i> a
barrer, don&rsquo;t you know, why not make this one your
own?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Cos I can&rsquo;t spare the
money,&rsquo; I ses.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he ses,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll find the money and the barrer&rsquo;s yourn, if
so be as you&rsquo;ll promise and vow to take up with no other
barrer, but stick to this one so long as you both shall
live.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, as aforesaid, it&rsquo;s a tidy, useful
barrer, and I agrees.&nbsp; But soon as it&rsquo;s <i>mine</i>,
don&rsquo;t you know, I ain&rsquo;t quite so careless about
it.&nbsp; I overhauls it, in a manner of speaking, and I&rsquo;m
more keerful in trying the balance of it in hand when the
load&rsquo;s on it.&nbsp; Well, maybe I find out what I never
before troubled myself to look for.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a screw
out here and a bolt wanted there.&nbsp; Here it&rsquo;s weak, and
there it&rsquo;s ugly.&nbsp; I dwells on it in my mind
constant.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never got that there barrer out of my
head, and p&rsquo;raps I make too much of the weak pints of
it.&nbsp; I gets to mistrust it.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all
middling right, just now, old woman&mdash;old barrer, I
mean,&rsquo; I ses to myself, &lsquo;but you&rsquo;ll be a
playing me a trick one day, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well,
I go on being afraid, which I shouldn&rsquo;t be if I was only a
borrower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you should not forget that the barrow, to adopt
your own ungallant figure of speech, is not accountable <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>for these
dreads and suspicions of yours; it will last you as long and as
well as though you had continued a borrower; you will admit that,
at least!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; <i>Last</i>, yes!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the beggaring part of it.&nbsp; Ah, well!
p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;s all right, but I&rsquo;m blest if I can
stand being haunted like I am now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing that I could say would add force to the argument of my
costermonger friend, as set forth in his parable of the
&ldquo;barrer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Applying it to the question under
discussion, I do not mean to attribute to the deceptiveness of
the barrow or to its premature breaking down, the spilling into
the gutter of all the unhappy children there discovered.&nbsp; My
main reason for admitting the evidence in question was to
endeavour to show that as a pet means of improving the morality
of our courts and alleys, and consequently of diminishing the
gutter population, the modern idea of arresting fornication and
concubinage, by dragging the pair there and then to church, and
making them man and wife, is open to serious objections.&nbsp;
The state of matrimony is not good for such folk.&nbsp; It was
never intended for them.&nbsp; It may be as necessary to
healthful life as eating is, but no one would think of taking a
man starved, and in the last extremity for lack of wholesome
aliment, and setting before him a great dish of solid food.&nbsp;
It may be good for him by-and-by, but he must be brought along by
degrees, and fitted for it.&nbsp; Undoubtedly a great source of
our abandoned gutter children may be found in the shocking
herding together of the sexes in the vile &ldquo;slums&rdquo; and
back places of London, and it is to be sincerely hoped <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>that some
wise man will presently devise a speedy preventive.</p>
<p>In a recent report made to the Commissioners of Sewers for
London, Dr. Letheby says: &ldquo;I have been at much pains during
the last three months to ascertain the precise conditions of the
dwellings, the habits, and the diseases of the poor.&nbsp; In
this way 2,208 rooms have been most circumstantially inspected,
and the general result is that nearly all of them are filthy or
overcrowded or imperfectly drained, or badly ventilated, or out
of repair.&nbsp; In 1,989 of these rooms, all in fact that are at
present inhabited, there are 5,791 inmates, belonging to 1,576
families; and to say nothing of the too frequent occurrence of
what may be regarded as a necessitous overcrowding, where the
husband, the wife, and young family of four or five children are
cramped into a miserably small and ill-conditioned room, there
are numerous instances where adults of both sexes, belonging to
different families, are lodged in the same room, regardless of
all the common decencies of life, and where from three to five
adults, men and women, besides a train or two of children, are
accustomed to herd together like brute beasts or savages; and
where every human instinct of propriety and decency is
smothered.&nbsp; Like my predecessor, I have seen grown persons
of both sexes sleeping in common with their parents, brothers and
sisters, and cousins, and even the casual acquaintance of a
day&rsquo;s tramp, occupying the same bed of filthy rags or
straw; a woman suffering in travail, in the midst of males and
females of different families that tenant the same room, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>where birth
and death go hand in hand; where the child but newly born, the
patient cast down with fever, and the corpse waiting for
interment, have no separation from each other, or from the rest
of the inmates.&nbsp; Of the many cases to which I have alluded,
there are some which have commanded my attention by reason of
their unusual depravity&mdash;cases in which from three to four
adults of both sexes, with many children, were lodging in the
same room, and often sleeping in the same bed.&nbsp; I have note
of three or four localities, where forty-eight men, seventy-three
women, and fifty-nine children are living in thirty-four
rooms.&nbsp; In one room there are two men, three women, and five
children, and in another one man, four women, and two children;
and when, about a fortnight since, I visited the back room on the
ground floor of No. 5, I found it occupied by one man, two women,
and two children; and in it was the dead body of a poor girl who
had died in childbirth a few days before.&nbsp; The body was
stretched out on the bare floor, without shroud or coffin.&nbsp;
There it lay in the midst of the living, and we may well ask how
it can be otherwise than that the human heart should be dead to
all the gentler feelings of our nature, when such sights as these
are of common occurrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So close and unwholesome is the atmosphere of some of
these rooms, that I have endeavoured to ascertain, by chemical
means, whether it does not contain some peculiar product of
decomposition that gives to it its foul odour and its rare powers
of engendering disease.&nbsp; I find it is not only deficient in
the due proportion of oxygen, but it contains three times the
usual amount of carbonic <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>acid, besides a quantity of aqueous
vapour charged with alkaline matter that stinks abominably.&nbsp;
This is doubtless the product of putrefaction, and of the various
f&oelig;tid and stagnant exhalations that pollute the air of the
place.&nbsp; In many of my former reports, and in those of my
predecessor, your attention has been drawn to this pestilential
source of disease, and to the consequence of heaping human beings
into such contracted localities; and I again revert to it because
of its great importance, not merely that it perpetuates fever and
the allied disorders, but because there stalks side by side with
this pestilence a yet deadlier presence, blighting the moral
existence of a rising population, rendering their hearts
hopeless, their acts ruffianly and incestuous, and scattering,
while society averts her eye, the retributive seeds of increase
for crime, turbulence and pauperism.&rdquo;</p>

Adopters</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>F. X.</i>&rdquo; <i>of

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> it is not possible, in a
book of moderate dimensions, such as this, to treat the question
of neglected children with that extended care and completeness it
undoubtedly deserves, any attempt at its consideration would be
glaringly deficient did it not include some reference to the
modern and murderous institution known as &ldquo;baby
farming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may rely on it that we are lamentably ignorant both of the
gigantic extent and the pernicious working of this
mischief.&nbsp; It is only when some loud-crying abuse of the
precious system makes itself heard in our criminal courts, and is
echoed in the newspapers, or when some adventurous magazine
writer in valiant pursuit of his avocation, directs his
inquisitive nose in the direction indicated, that the public at
large hear anything either of the farmer or the farmed.</p>
<p>A year or so ago a most atrocious child murder attracted
towards this ugly subject the bull&rsquo;s-eye beams of the
press, and for some time it was held up and exhibited in all its
nauseating nakedness.&nbsp; It may be safely asserted that during
the protracted trial of the child murderess, Mrs. <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Winser, there
was not one horrified father or mother in England who did not in
terms of severest indignation express his or her opinion of how
abominable it was that such scandalous traffic in baby flesh and
blood should, through the law&rsquo;s inefficiency, be rendered
possible.&nbsp; But it was only while we, following the revolting
revelations, were subject to a succession of shocks and kept in
pain, that we were thus virtuous.&nbsp; It was only while our
tender feelings were suffering excruciation from the harrowing
story of baby torture that we shook in wrath against the
torturer.&nbsp; Considering what our sufferings were (and from
the manner of our crying out they must have been truly awful) we
recovered with a speed little short of miraculous.&nbsp; Barely
was the trial of the murderess concluded and the court cleared,
than our fierce indignation subsided from its bubbling and
boiling, and quickly settled down to calm and ordinary
temperature.&nbsp; Nay it is hardly too much to say that our
over-wrought sympathies as regards baby neglect and murder fell
so cold and flat that little short of a second edition of
Herod&rsquo;s massacre might be required to raise them again.</p>
<p>This is the unhappy fate that attends nearly all our great
social grievances.&nbsp; They are overlooked or shyly glanced at
and kicked aside for years and years, when suddenly a stray spark
ignites their smouldering heaps, and the eager town cooks a
splendid supper of horrors at the gaudy conflagration; but having
supped full, there ensues a speedy distaste for flame and smoke,
and in his heart every one is chiefly anxious that the fire may
burn itself out, or that some kind hand will smother it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>have had enough of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is the
phrase.&nbsp; The only interest we ever had in it, which was
nothing better than a selfish and theatrical interest, is
exhausted.&nbsp; We enjoyed the bonfire amazingly, but we have no
idea of tucking back our coat-sleeves and handling a shovel or a
pick to explore the unsavoury depth and origin of the flareup,
and dig and dam to guard against a repetition of it.&nbsp; It is
sufficient for us that we have endured without flinching the
sensational horrors dragged to light; let those who dragged them
forth bury them again; or kill them; or be killed by them.&nbsp;
We have had enough of them.</p>
<p>Great social grievances are not to be taken by storm.&nbsp;
They merely bow their vile heads while the wrathful blast passes,
and regain their original position immediately afterwards.&nbsp;
So it was with this business of baby-farming, and the tremendous
outcry raised at the time when the wretch Winser was brought to
trial.&nbsp; There are certain newspapers in whose advertisement
columns the baby-farmer advertises for &ldquo;live stock&rdquo;
constantly, and at the time it was observed with great triumph by
certain people that since the vile hag&rsquo;s detection the
advertisements in question had grown singularly few and
mild.&nbsp; But the hope that the baby-farmer had retired,
regarding his occupation as gone, was altogether delusive.&nbsp;
He was merely lying quiet for a spell, quite at his ease, making
no doubt that business would stir again presently.&nbsp; Somebody
else was doing his advertising, that was all.&nbsp; If he had had
any reasonable grounds for supposing that the results of the
appalling facts brought to light would be that the Legislature
would bestir itself and take prompt <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>and efficacious steps towards
abolishing him, it would have been different.&nbsp; But he had
too much confidence in the sluggardly law to suppose anything of
the kind.&nbsp; He knew that the details of the doings of himself
and his fellows would presently sicken those who for a time had
evinced a relish for them, and that in a short time they would
bid investigators and newspapers say no more&mdash;they had had
enough of it!&nbsp; When his sagacity was verified, he found his
way leisurely back to the advertising columns again.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the baby-farmers as masculine, but that was
merely for convenience of metaphor.&nbsp; No doubt that the male
sex have a considerable interest in the trade, but the
negociators, and ostensibly the proprietors, are women.&nbsp; As
I write, one of the said newspapers lies before me.&nbsp; It is a
daily paper, and its circulation, an extensive one, is
essentially amongst the working classes, <i>especially amongst
working girls and women</i>.</p>
<p>The words italicised are worthy particular attention as
regards this particular part of my subject.&nbsp; Here is a daily
newspaper that is mainly an advertising broadsheet.&nbsp; It is
an old-established newspaper, and its advertisement columns may
be said fairly to reflect the condition of the female labour
market over vast tracts of the London district.&nbsp; Column
after column tells of the wants of servants and masters.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cap-hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;feather-hands,&rdquo;
&ldquo;artificial flower-hands,&rdquo;
&ldquo;chenille-hands,&rdquo; hands for the manufacture of
&ldquo;chignons&rdquo; and &ldquo;hair-nets&rdquo; and
&ldquo;bead work,&rdquo; and all manner of &ldquo;plaiting&rdquo;
and &ldquo;quilling&rdquo; and &ldquo;gauffering&rdquo; in ribbon
and net and muslin, <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>contributing towards the thousand and one articles that
stock the &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; trade.&nbsp; There are more
newspapers than one that aspire as mediums between employers and
employed, but this, before all others, is <i>the</i> newspaper,
daily conned by thousands of girls and women in search of work of
the kind above mentioned, and it is in this newspaper that the
baby-farmer fishes wholesale for customers.</p>
<p>I write &ldquo;wholesale,&rdquo; and surely it is nothing
else.&nbsp; To the uninitiated in this peculiar branch of the
world&rsquo;s wickedness it would seem that, as an article of
negociation, a baby would figure rarer than anything, and in
their innocence they might be fairly guided to this conclusion on
the evidence of their personal experience of the unflinching love
of parents, though never so poor, for their children; yet in a
single number of this newspaper published every day of the week
and all the year round, be it borne in mind, appear no less than
<i>eleven</i> separate advertisements, emanating from individuals
solicitous for the care, weekly, monthly, yearly&mdash;anyhow, of
other people&rsquo;s children, and that on terms odorous of
starvation at the least in every meagre figure.</p>
<p>It is evident at a glance that the advertisers seek for
customers and expect none other than from among the sorely
pinched and poverty-stricken class that specially patronise the
newspaper in question.&nbsp; The complexion, tone, and terms of
their villanously cheap suggestions for child adoption are most
cunningly shaped to meet the possible requirements of some
unfortunate work-girl, who, earning while at liberty never more
than seven or <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>eight shillings a week, finds herself hampered with an
infant for whom no father is forthcoming.&nbsp; There can
scarcely be imagined a more terrible encumbrance than a young
baby is to a working girl or woman so circumstanced.&nbsp; Very
often she has a home before her disaster announced
itself&mdash;her first home, that is, with her parents&mdash;and
in her shame and disgrace she abandons it, determined on hiding
away where she is unknown, &ldquo;keeping herself to
herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; She has no other means of earning a
livelihood excepting that she has been used to.&nbsp; She is a
&ldquo;cap-hand,&rdquo; or an &ldquo;artificial
flower-hand,&rdquo; and such work is always entirely performed at
the warehouse immediately under the employer&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp;
What is she to do?&nbsp; She cannot possibly carry her baby with
her to the shop and keep it with her the livelong day.&nbsp; Were
she inclined so to do, and could somehow contrive to accomplish
the double duty of nurse and flower-weaver, it would not be
allowed.&nbsp; If she stays at home in the wretched little room
she rents with her infant she and it must go hungry.&nbsp; It is
a terrible dilemma for a young woman &ldquo;all but&rdquo; good,
and honestly willing to accept the grievous penalty she must pay
if it may be accomplished by the labour of her hands.&nbsp; Small
and puny, however, the poor unwelcome little stranger may be, it
is a perfect ogre of rapacity on its unhappy mother&rsquo;s
exertions.&nbsp; Now and then an instance of the self-sacrificing
devotion exhibited by those unhappy mothers for their fatherless
children creeps into print.&nbsp; There was held in the parish of
St. Luke&rsquo;s, last summer, an inquest on the body of a
neglected infant, aged seven months.&nbsp; The woman to whose
care she was <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>confided had got drunk, and left the poor little thing
exposed to the cold, so that it died.&nbsp; The mother paid the
drunken nurse four-and-sixpence a week for the child&rsquo;s
keep, and it was proved in evidence that she (the mother) had
been earning at her trade of paper-bag making never more than
six-and-threepence per week during the previous five
months.&nbsp; That was four-and-sixpence for baby and
<i>one-and-ninepence</i> for herself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, however, that the regular baby-farmer is
a person habitually given to drink.&nbsp; The successful and
lucrative prosecution of her business forbids the
indulgence.&nbsp; Decidedly not one of the eleven advertisements
before mentioned read like the concoctions of persons whose heads
were muddled with beer or gin.&nbsp; Here is the first
one:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>NURSE CHILD WANTED, OR TO ADOPT.&mdash;The
Advertiser, a Widow with a little family of her own, and a
moderate allowance from her late husband&rsquo;s friends, would
be glad to accept the charge of a young child.&nbsp; Age no
object.&nbsp; If sickly would receive a parent&rsquo;s
care.&nbsp; Terms, Fifteen Shillings a month; or would adopt
entirely if under two months for the small sum of Twelve
pounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Women are shrewder than men at understanding these matters,
and the advertisement is addressed to women; but I doubt if a man
would be far wrong in setting down the &ldquo;widow lady with a
little family of her own,&rdquo; as one of those monsters in
woman&rsquo;s clothing who go about seeking for babies to
devour.&nbsp; Her &ldquo;moderate allowance,&rdquo; so artlessly
introduced, is intended to convey to the unhappy mother but half
resolved to part with her <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>encumbrance, that possibly the
widow&rsquo;s late husband&rsquo;s friends settle her
butcher&rsquo;s and baker&rsquo;s bills, and that under such
circumstances the widow would actually be that fifteen shillings
a month in pocket, for the small trouble of entering the little
stranger with her own interesting little flock.&nbsp; And what a
well-bred, cheerful, and kindly-behaved little flock it must be,
to have no objection to add to its number a young child aged one
month or twelve, sick or well!&nbsp; Fancy such an estimable
person as the widow lady appraising her parental care at so low a
figure as three-and-ninepence a week&mdash;sevenpence farthing a
day, including Sundays!&nbsp; But, after all, that is not so
cheap as the taking the whole and sole charge of a child, sick or
well, mind you, to nourish and clothe, and educate it from the
age of two months till twelve years, say!&nbsp; To be sure, the
widow lady stipulates that the child she is ready to
&ldquo;adopt&rdquo; must be under two months, and we all know how
precarious is infantine existence, and at what a wonderfully low
rate the cheap undertakers bury babies in these days.</p>
<p>Another of the precious batch of eleven speaks plainer, and
comes to the point without any preliminary walking round
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>ADOPTION.&mdash;A person wishing a lasting and
comfortable home for a young child of either sex will find this a
good opportunity.&nbsp; Advertisers having no children of their
own are about to proceed to America.&nbsp; Premium, Fifteen
pounds.&nbsp; Respectable references given and required.&nbsp;
Address F. X&mdash;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that is incomplete in the above is the initials; but <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>one need not
ask for the &ldquo;O&rdquo; that should come between the
&ldquo;F&rdquo; and &ldquo;X.&rdquo;&nbsp; After perusing the
pithy advertisement, I interpreted its meaning simply
this:&mdash;Any person possessed of a child he is anxious to be
rid of, here is a good chance for him.&nbsp; Perhaps &ldquo;F.
X.&rdquo; is going to America; perhaps he&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; That
is <i>his</i> business.&nbsp; The party having a child to dispose
of, need not trouble itself on that score.&nbsp; For
&ldquo;respectable references&rdquo; read &ldquo;mutual
confidence.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take the child, and ask no
questions of the party, and the party shall fork over the fifteen
pounds, and ask no questions of me.&nbsp; That will make matters
comfortable for both parties, &rsquo;specially if the meeting is
at a coffee-house, or at some public building, for if I
don&rsquo;t know the party&rsquo;s address, of course he can have
no fear that I shall turn round on him, and return the child on
his hands.&nbsp; The whole affair might be managed while an
omnibus is waiting to take up a passenger.&nbsp; A simple matter
of handing over a bulky parcel and a little one&mdash;the child
and the money&mdash;and all over, without so much as &ldquo;good
night,&rdquo; if so be the party is a careful party, and
wouldn&rsquo;t like even his voice heard.</p>
<p>It may be objected that the seduced factory girl is scarcely
likely to become the victim of &ldquo;F. X.,&rdquo; inasmuch as
she never had fifteen pounds to call her own in the whole course
of her life, and is less likely than ever to grow so rich
now.&nbsp; And that is quite true, but as well as a seduced,
there must be a seducer.&nbsp; Not a man of position and means,
probably; more likely the fast young son of parents in the
butchering, or cheesemongering, or grocery interest&mdash;a
dashing young blade, whose ideas of <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>&ldquo;seeing life&rdquo; is seeking
that unwholesome phase of it presented at those unmitigated dens
of vice, the &ldquo;music halls,&rdquo; at one of which places,
probably, the acquaintance terminating so miserably, was
commenced.&nbsp; Or, may be, instead of the &ldquo;young
master,&rdquo; it is the shopman who is the male delinquent; and,
in either case, anything is preferable to a &ldquo;row,&rdquo;
and an exposure.&nbsp; Possibly the embarrassed young mother, by
stress of necessity, and imperfect faith in the voluntary
goodness of her lover, is driven to make the best of the
defensive weapons that chance has thus placed in her hands, and
her urging for &ldquo;some little assistance&rdquo; becomes
troublesome.&nbsp; This being the case, and the devil stepping in
with &ldquo;F. X.&rsquo;s&rdquo; advertisement in his hand, the
difficulty is immediately reduced to one of raising fifteen
pounds.&nbsp; No more hourly anxiety lest &ldquo;something should
turn up&rdquo; to explode the secret under the very nose of
parents or master, no more restrictions from amusements loved so
well because of a dread lest that pale-faced baby-carrying young
woman should intrude her reproachful presence, and her tears,
into their midst.&nbsp; Only one endeavour&mdash;a big one, it is
true, but still, only one&mdash;and the ugly ghost is laid at
once and for ever!&nbsp; Perhaps the young fellow has friends of
whom he can borrow the money.&nbsp; May be he has a watch, and
articles of clothing and jewellery, that will pawn for the
amount.&nbsp; If he has neither, still he is not entirely without
resources.&nbsp; Music-halls and dancing-rooms cannot be
patronised on bare journeyman&rsquo;s wages, and probably already
the till has bled slightly&mdash;let it bleed more
copiously!&nbsp; And the theft is perpetrated, and &ldquo;F.
X.&rdquo; <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>releases the guilty pair of the little creature that
looks in its helplessness and innocence so little like a
bugbear.&nbsp; And it isn&rsquo;t at all unlikely that, after
all, papa regards himself as a fellow deserving of condemnation,
perhaps, but entitled to some pity, and, still more, of approval
for his self-sacrificing.&nbsp; Another fellow, finding himself
in such a fix, would have snapped his fingers in Polly&rsquo;s
face, and told her to do her worst, and be hanged to her; but,
confound it all, he was not such a brute as <i>that</i>.&nbsp;
Having got the poor girl into trouble, he had done all he could
to get her out of it&mdash;clean out of it, mind you.&nbsp; Not
only had he done all that he could towards this generous end, but
considerably more than he ought; he had risked exposure as a
thief, and the penalty of the treadmill, and all for her
sake!&nbsp; And so thick-skinned is the young fellow&rsquo;s
morality, that possibly he is really not aware of the double-dyed
villain he has become; that to strip his case of the specious
wrappings in which he would envelop it, he is nothing better than
a mean scoundrel who has stooped to till-robbery in order to
qualify himself as an accessory to child murder, or
worse&mdash;the casting of his own offspring, like a mangy dog,
on the streets, to die in a gutter, or to live and grow up to be
a terror to his kind&mdash;a ruffian, and a breeder of
ruffians.&nbsp; Nor need it be supposed that this last is a mere
fancy sketch.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that if the history of
every one of the ten thousand of the young human pariahs that
haunt London streets could be inquired into, it would be found
that no insignificant percentage of the whole were children
abandoned and left to their fate by mock &ldquo;adopters,&rdquo;
such as &ldquo;F. X.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>It is
these &ldquo;adopters&rdquo; of children who should be specially
looked after, since, assuming that heartless roguery is the basis
of their business dealing, it becomes at once manifest that their
main source of profit must lie in their ability to get rid of
their hard bargains as soon as possible.&nbsp; From fifteen to
five-and-twenty pounds would appear to be the sums usually asked,
and having once got possession of the child, every day that the
mockery of a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> bargain is maintained, the
value of the blood-money that came with it diminishes.&nbsp; The
term &ldquo;blood-money,&rdquo; however, should be accepted in a
qualified sense.&nbsp; It is quite common for these people to
mention as one of the conditions of treaty that a sickly child
would not be objected to, and provided it were very sickly, it
might in ordinary cases have a fair chance of dying a natural
death; but the course commonly pursued by the professional
childmonger is not to murder it either by sudden and violent
means, or by the less merciful though no less sure process of
cold, neglect, and starvation.&nbsp; Not only does death made
public (and in these wide-awake times it is not easy to hide a
body, though a little one, where it may not speedily be found)
attract an amount of attention that were best avoided, but it
also entails the expenses of burial.&nbsp; A much easier way of
getting rid of a child,&mdash;especially if it be of that
convenient age when it is able to walk but not to talk, is to
convey it to a strange quarter of the town and there abandon
it.</p>
<p>And there is something else in connection with this painful
phase of the question of neglected children that should not be
lost sight of.&nbsp; It must not be supposed that <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>every child
abandoned in the streets is discovered by the police and finds
its way first to the station-house, and finally to the
workhouse.&nbsp; Very many of them, especially if they are
pretty-looking and engaging children, are voluntarily adopted by
strangers.&nbsp; It might not be unreasonably imagined that this
can only be the case when the cruel abandonment takes place in a
neighbourhood chiefly inhabited by well-to-do people.&nbsp; And
well would it be for the community at large if this supposition
were the correct one; then there would be a chance that the poor
neglected little waif would be well cared for and preserved
against the barbarous injustice of being compelled to fight for
his food even before he had shed his milk-teeth.&nbsp; But
wonderful as it may seem, it is not in well-to-do quarters that
the utterly abandoned child finds protection, but in quarters
that are decidedly the worst to do, and that, unfortunately, in
every possible respect than any within the city&rsquo;s
limits.&nbsp; The tender consideration of poverty for its kind is
a phase of humanity that might be studied both with instruction
and profit by those who, through their gold-rimmed spectacles
regard deprivation from meat and clothes and the other good
things of this world as involving a corresponding deficiency of
virtue and generosity.&nbsp; They have grown so accustomed to
associate cherubs with chubbiness, and chubbiness with high
respectability and rich gravies, that they would, if such a thing
were possible, scarcely be seen conversing with an angel of bony
and vulgar type.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is an undoubted fact,
that for one child taken from the streets in the highly
respectable West-end, and privately housed <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and taken
care of, there might be shown fifty who have found open door and
lasting entertainment in the most poverty-stricken haunts of
London.</p>
<p>In haunts of vice too, in hideous localities inhabited solely
by loose women and thieves.&nbsp; Bad as these people are, they
will not deny a hungry child.&nbsp; It is curious the extent to
which this lingering of nature&rsquo;s better part remains with
these &ldquo;bad women.&rdquo;&nbsp; Love for little children in
these poor creatures seems unconquerable.&nbsp; It would appear
as though conscious of the extreme depth of degradation to which
they have fallen, and of the small amount of sympathy that
remains between them and the decent world, they were anxious to
hold on yet a little longer, although by so slender a thread as
unreasoning childhood affords.&nbsp; As everyone can attest,
whose duty it has been to explore even the most notorious sinks
of vice and criminality, it is quite common to meet with pretty
little children, mere infants of three or four years old, who are
the pets and toys of the inhabitants, especially of the
women.&nbsp; The frequent answer to the inquiry, &ldquo;Who does
the child belong to?&rdquo; is, &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s
anybody&rsquo;s child,&rdquo; which sometimes means that it is
the offspring of one of the fraternity who has died or is now in
prison, but more often that he is a &ldquo;stray&rdquo; who is
fed and harboured there simply because nobody owns him.</p>
<p>But as may be easily understood, the reign of
&ldquo;pets&rdquo; of this sort is of limited duration.&nbsp; By
the time the curly-headed little boy of four years old grows to
be six, he must indeed be an inapt scholar if his two
years&rsquo; attendance at such a school has not turned his
artless simplicity <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>into mischievous cunning, and his &ldquo;pretty
ways&rdquo; into those that are both audacious and
tiresome.&nbsp; Then clubbing takes the place of caressing, and
the child is gradually left to shift for himself, and we meet him
shortly afterwards an active and intelligent nuisance, snatching
his hard-earned crust out of the mire as a crossing sweeper,
fusee, or penny-paper selling boy, or else more evilly inclined,
he joins other companions and takes up the trade of a whining
beggar.&nbsp; Even at that tender age his eyes are opened to the
ruinous fact that as much may be got by stealing as by working,
and he &ldquo;tails on,&rdquo; a promising young beginner, to the
army of twenty thousand professional thieves that exact black
mail in London.</p>
<p>Supposing it to be true, and for my part I sincerely believe
it, that the ranks of neglected children who eventually become
thieves, are recruited in great part from the castaways of the
mock child adopter, then is solved the puzzle how it is that
among a class the origin of almost every member of which can be
traced back to the vilest neighbourhood of brutishness and
ignorance, so many individuals of more than the average intellect
are discovered.&nbsp; Any man who has visited a reformatory for
boys must have observed this.&nbsp; Let him go into the juvenile
ward or the school-room of a workhouse, either in town or
country, and he will find four-fifths of the lads assembled
wearing the same heavy stolid look, indicative of the same
desperate resignation to the process of learning than which for
them could hardly be devised a punishment more severe.&nbsp; But
amongst a very large proportion <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>of the boys who have been rescued not
merely from the gutter but out of the very jaws of the criminal
law, and bestowed in our reformatories, how different is their
aspect!&nbsp; Quick-witted, ready of comprehension, bold-eyed,
shrewdly-observant, one cannot but feel that it is a thousand
pities that such boys should be driven to this harbour of
refuge&mdash;that so much good manhood material should come so
nigh to being wrecked.&nbsp; But how is it that with no more
promising nurses than squalor and ignorance the boys of the
reformatory should show so much superior to the boys whom a
national institution, such as a workhouse is, has adopted, and
had all to do with since their infancy?&nbsp; The theory that
many of the boys who by rapid steps in crime find their way to a
reformatory, are bastard children, for whose safe-keeping the
baby farmer was once briefly responsible, goes far towards
solving the riddle.&nbsp; The child-adopting fraternity is an
extensive one, and finds clients in all grades of society, and
there can be little doubt that in instances innumerable, while
Alley Jack is paying the penalty of his evil behaviour by turning
for his bread on the treadmill, his brothers, made legitimate by
the timely reformation and marriage of Alley Jack&rsquo;s father,
are figuring in their proper sphere, and leisurely and profitably
developing the intellect they inherit from their brilliant
papa.&nbsp; Alley Jack, too, has his share of the family
talent&mdash;all the brain, all the sensitiveness, all the
&ldquo;blood&rdquo; of the respectable stock a reckless sprig of
which is responsible for Jack&rsquo;s being.&nbsp; It is only in
the nature of things to suppose that Jack&rsquo;s blood is
tainted with the <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>wildness of wicked papa; and here we have in Alley Jack
a type of that bold intellectual villain whose clique of fifty or
so, as Lord Shaftesbury recently declared, is more to be dreaded
than as many hundred of the dull and plodding sort of thief, the
story of whose exploits figure daily in the newspapers.</p>
<p>We have, however, a little wandered away from the subject in
hand, which is not concerning neglected children who have become
thieves, but neglected children, simply, whose future is not as
yet ascertained.&nbsp; Speaking of the professional child farmer,
it has been already remarked that his sole object, as regards
these innocents that are adopted for a sum paid down, is to get
rid of them as secretly and quickly as possible.&nbsp; And
assuming the preservation of health and life in the little mortal
to be of the first importance, there can be no question that he
has a better chance of both, even though his treacherous
&ldquo;adopter&rdquo; deserts him on a doorstep, than if he were
so kindly cruel as to tolerate his existence at the
&ldquo;farm.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is those unfortunate infants who are
not &ldquo;adopted,&rdquo; but merely housed and fed at so much
per week or month, who are the greater sufferers.&nbsp; True, it
is to the interest of the practitioners who adopt this branch of
baby-farming to keep life in their little charges, since with
their death terminates the more or less profitable contract
entered into between themselves and the child&rsquo;s parent or
guardian; but no less true is it that it is to the
&ldquo;farmers&rsquo;&rdquo; interest and profit to keep down
their expenditure in the nursery at as low an ebb as is
consistent with the bare existence of its luckless
inhabitants.&nbsp; The child is welcome <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>to live on
starvation diet just as long as it may.&nbsp; It is very welcome
indeed to do so, since the longer it holds out, the larger the
number of shillings the ogres that have it in charge will be
enabled to grind out of its poor little bones.&nbsp; These are
not the &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; who append to their advertisements
the notification that &ldquo;children of ill-health are not
objected to.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are by far too good judges for
that.&nbsp; What they rejoice in is a fine, robust,
healthy-lunged child, with whom some such noble sum as a shilling
a day is paid.&nbsp; Such an article is as good as a gift of
twenty pounds to them.&nbsp; See the amount of privation such a
child can stand before it succumbs!&nbsp; The tenacity of life in
children of perfectly sound constitution is proverbial.&nbsp; A
ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of bread, and a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of
milk daily will suffice to keep the machinery of life from coming
to a sudden standstill.&nbsp; By such a barely sufficient link
will the poor little helpless victim be held to life, while what
passes as natural causes attack and gradually consume it, and
drag it down to its grave.&nbsp; This, in the baby-farmer&rsquo;s
estimation, is a first-rate article&mdash;the pride of the
market, and without doubt the most profitable.&nbsp; The safest
too.&nbsp; Children will pine.&nbsp; Taken from their mother, it
is only to be expected that they should.&nbsp; Therefore, when
the poor mother, who is working of nights as well as days, that
&ldquo;nurse&rsquo;s money&rdquo; may be punctually paid, visits
her little one, and finds it thin and pale and wasting, she is
not amazed, although her conscience smites her cruelly, and her
heart is fit to break.&nbsp; She is only too thankful to hear
&ldquo;nurse&rdquo; declare that she is doing all she can for the
little darling.&nbsp; It is her only consolation, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>and she goes
away hugging it while &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; and her old man make
merry over gin bought with that hard, hard-earned extra sixpence
that the poor mother has left to buy baby some little
comfort.</p>
<p>I trust and hope that what is here set down will not be
regarded as mere tinsel and wordy extravagance designed to
produce a &ldquo;sensation&rdquo; in the mind of the
reader.&nbsp; There is no telling into whose hands a book may
fall.&nbsp; Maybe, it is not altogether impossible eyes may scan
this page that have been recently red with weeping over the
terrible secret that will keep but a little longer, and for the
inevitable launching of which provision must be made.&nbsp; To
such a reader, with all kindliness, I would whisper words of
counsel.&nbsp; Think not &ldquo;twice,&rdquo; but many times
before you adopt the &ldquo;readiest&rdquo; means of shirking the
awful responsibility you have incurred.&nbsp; Rely on it, you
will derive no lasting satisfaction out of this
&ldquo;readiest&rdquo; way, by which, of course, is meant the way
to which the villanous child-farmer reveals an open door.&nbsp;
Be righteously courageous, and take any step rather, as you would
I am sure if you were permitted to raise a corner and peep behind
the curtain that conceals the hidden mysteries of adopted-child
murder.</p>
<p>As a volunteer explorer into the depths of social mysteries,
once upon a time I made it my business to invade the den of a
child-farmer.&nbsp; The result of the experiment was printed in a
daily newspaper or magazine at the time, so I will here make but
brief allusion to it.&nbsp; I bought the current number of the
newspaper more than once here mentioned, and discovering, as
usual, a considerable string <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>of child-adopting and nursing
advertisements, I replied to the majority of them, professing to
have a child &ldquo;on my hands,&rdquo; and signing myself
&ldquo;M. D.&rdquo;&nbsp; My intention being to trap the
villains, I need not say that in every case my reply to their
preliminary communications was couched in such
carefully-considered terms as might throw the most suspicious off
their guard.&nbsp; But I found that I had under-estimated the
cunning of the enemy.&nbsp; Although the innocent-seeming bait
was made as attractive and savoury as possible, at least half of
the farmers to whom my epistles were addressed vouchsafed no
reply.&nbsp; There was something about it not to their liking,
evidently.</p>
<p>Three or four of the hungry pike bit, however, one being a
lady signing herself &ldquo;Y. Z.&rdquo;&nbsp; In her newspaper
advertisement, if I rightly remember, persons whom it concerned
were to address, &ldquo;Y. Z.,&rdquo; Post Office, &mdash;
Street, Stepney.&nbsp; &ldquo;Y. Z.&rdquo; replying to mine so
addressed, said that, as before stated, she was willing to adopt
a little girl of weakly constitution at the terms I suggested,
her object being chiefly to secure a companion for her own little
darling, who had lately, through death, been deprived of his own
dear little sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;Y. Z.&rdquo; further suggested
that I should appoint a place where we could &ldquo;meet and
arrange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, however, was not what I wanted.&nbsp; It was quite
evident from the tone of the lady&rsquo;s note that she was not
at all desirous that the meeting should take place at her
abode.&nbsp; Again I was to address, &ldquo;Post
Office.&rdquo;&nbsp; To bring matters to a conclusion, I wrote,
declaring that nothing could be done unless I could meet
&ldquo;Y. Z.&rdquo; <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>at her own abode.&nbsp; No answer was returned to this
my last, and it was evidently the intention of &ldquo;Y.
Z.&rdquo; to let the matter drop.</p>
<p>I was otherwise resolved, however.&nbsp; I had some sort of
clue, and was resolved to follow it up.&nbsp; By what subtle arts
and contrivance I managed to trace &ldquo;Y. Z.&rdquo; from
&ldquo;Post Office&rdquo; to her abode need not here be
recited.&nbsp; Armed with her real name and the number of the
street in which she resided, I arrived at the house, and at the
door of it just as the postman was rapping to deliver a letter to
the very party I had come uninvited to visit.&nbsp; I may say
that the house was of the small four or five-roomed order, and no
more or less untidy or squalid than is commonly to be found in
the back streets of Stepney or Bethnal Green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oxleek&rdquo; was the original of &ldquo;Y. Z.,&rdquo;
and of the slatternly, ragged-haired girl who opened the door I
asked if that lady was at home.&nbsp; The young woman said that
she was out&mdash;that she had &ldquo;gone to the
Li-ver.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young woman spoke with a rapid
utterance, and was evidently in a mighty hurry to get back to
some business the postman&rsquo;s knock had summoned her
from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, miss, gone to the &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li-ver; where you pays in for young uns&rsquo; berryins
and that,&rdquo; she responded; &ldquo;she ain&rsquo;t at home,
but he is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so she did.&nbsp; And presently a husky voice from the
next floor called out, &ldquo;Hullo! what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a gentleman wants yer, and here&rsquo;s a
letter as the postman jest left.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;Ask him if he&rsquo;s the doctor; I&rsquo;ve got
the young un, I can&rsquo;t come down,&rdquo; the husky voice was
again heard to exclaim.</p>
<p>To be sure I was not a doctor, not a qualified practitioner
that is to say, but as far as the Oxleek family knew me I was
&ldquo;M.D.;&rdquo; and pacifying my grumbling conscience with
this small piece of jesuitism, I blandly nodded my head to the
young woman when she recited to me Mr. Oxleek&rsquo;s query.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better go up, and p&rsquo;raps you
wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking this letter up with you,&rdquo; said
she.</p>
<p>I went up; it was late in the evening and candlelight, in the
room on the next floor that is, but not on the stairs; but had it
been altogether dark, I might have discovered Mr. Oxleek by the
stench of his tobacco.&nbsp; I walked in at the half-open
door.</p>
<p>There was Mr. Oxleek by the fire, the very perfection of an
indolent, ease-loving, pipe-smoking, beer-soaking wretch as ever
sat for his portrait.&nbsp; He was a man verging on fifty, I
should think, with a pair of broad shoulders fit to carry a side
of beef, and as greasy about the cuffs and collar of his tattered
jacket as though at some early period of his existence he had
carried sides of beef.&nbsp; But that must have been many years
ago, for the grease had all worn black with age, and the
shoulders of the jacket were all fretted through by constant
friction against the back of the easy-chair he sat in.&nbsp; He
wore slippers&mdash;at least, he wore <i>one</i> slipper; the
other one, all slouched down at heel, had slipped off his lazy
foot a few inches too far for easy recovery, and there it
lay.&nbsp; A villanously dirty <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>face had Mr. Oxleek, and a beard of
at least a month&rsquo;s growth.&nbsp; It was plain to be seen
that one of Mr. Oxleek&rsquo;s most favourite positions of
sitting was with his head resting against that part of the wall
that was by the side of the mantelshelf, for there, large as a
dinner plate, was the black greasy patch his dirty hair had
made.&nbsp; He had been smoking, for there, still smouldering,
was his filthy little pipe on the shelf, and by the side of it a
yellow jug all streaked and stained with ancient smears of
beer.</p>
<p>He was not quite unoccupied, however; he was nursing a
baby!&nbsp; He, the pipe-sucking, beer-swigging, unshaven, dirty,
lazy ruffian, was nursing a poor little creature less than a year
old, as I should judge, with its small, pinched face reposing
against his ragged waistcoat, in the pocket of which his tobacco
was probably kept.&nbsp; The baby wore its bedgown, as though it
had once been put to bed, and roused to be nursed.&nbsp; It was a
very old and woefully begrimed bedgown, bearing marks of Mr.
Oxleek&rsquo;s dirty paws, and of his tobacco dust, and of physic
clumsily administered and spilt.&nbsp; It would appear too much
like &ldquo;piling up the agony&rdquo; did I attempt to describe
that baby&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; It was the countenance of an infant
that had cried itself to sleep, and to whom pain was so familiar,
that it invaded its dreams, causing its mites of features to
twitch and quiver so that it would have been a mercy to wake
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evening, sir; take a cheer!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Oxleek,
quite hospitably; &ldquo;this is the young un, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very odd.&nbsp; Clearly there was a great mistake
somewhere, and yet as far as they had gone, the proceedings <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>were not much
at variance with the original text.&nbsp; I was
&ldquo;M.D.,&rdquo; and a doctor was expected.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
was the young un,&rdquo; Mr. Oxleek declared, and a young one, a
bereaved young one who had lost his darling playmate, was a
prominent feature in his wife&rsquo;s letter to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that the young one?&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a heap of trouble; going after the last, I&rsquo;m
afeard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same symptoms, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same.&nbsp; Reg&rsquo;ler handful she is, and
no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This then was <i>not</i> the &ldquo;young un&rdquo; Mrs.
Oxleek had written about.&nbsp; This was a girl, it seemed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, how long is it since a medical man saw the
child?&rdquo; I inquired, I am afraid in a tone that roused
suspicion in Mr. Oxleek&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know, when he came last week&mdash;you&rsquo;re
come instead of him?&nbsp; You <i>have</i> come instead of him,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
come to talk about that advertisement of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Oxleek for a moment looked blank, but only for a
moment.&nbsp; He saw the trap just as he was about to set his
foot in it, and withdrew in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; he remarked, impudently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must beg your pardon, it is here.&nbsp; You
forget.&nbsp; I wrote to you as M.D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Mr. Oxleek had seized and lit his short pipe, and
was puffing away at it with great vigour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re come to the wrong shop, I tell you,&rdquo;
he replied, from behind the impenetrable cloud; &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>know no &lsquo;M.D.&rsquo; nor M.P., nor M. anythink;
it&rsquo;s a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if I show you your wife&rsquo;s writing, you
will be convinced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s all a mistake, I tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat down on a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will your wife be long before she returns?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say&mdash;oh, here she comes; <i>now</i>
p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ll believe that you&rsquo;re come to the
wrong shop.&nbsp; My dear, what do we know about M.D.&rsquo;s, or
advertising, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Oxleek was a short, fat woman, with a sunny smile on her
florid face, and a general air of content about her.&nbsp; She
had brought in with her a pot of beer and a quantity of pork
sausages for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she repeated instantly, taking the cue,
&ldquo;who says that we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman&rsquo;s been a tacklin&rsquo; me a good
&rsquo;un, I can tell you!&mdash;says that he&rsquo;s got your
writing to show for summat or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my writing?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Oxleek,
defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is it, if I am not mistaken,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I displayed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s where it is, you see,&rdquo; said she,
with a triumphant chuckle, &ldquo;you <i>are</i> mistaken.&nbsp;
You are only wasting your time, my good sir.&nbsp; My name
isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Y. Z.,&rsquo; and never was.&nbsp; Allow me to
light you down-stairs, my good sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>And I
did allow her.&nbsp; What else could I do?&nbsp; At the same
time, and although my investigations led to nothing at all, I
came away convinced, as doubtless the reader is, that there was
no &ldquo;mistake,&rdquo; and that Mr. and Mrs. Oxleek were of
the tribe of ogres who fatten on little children.</p>
<p>Singularly enough, as I revise these pages for the press,
there appears in the newspapers a grimly apt illustration of the
above statement.&nbsp; So exactly do the details of the case in
question bear out the arguments used in support of my views of
baby-farming, that I will take the liberty of setting the matter
before the reader just as it was set before the coroner.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An investigation of a singular character
was held by Mr. Richards on Thursday night, at the Lord Campbell
Tavern, Bow, respecting the death of Frederick Wood, aged two
years and three months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss A. W&mdash;, of Hoxton, said deceased was a sickly
child, and ten months ago witness took it to Mrs. Savill, of 24,
Swayton Road, Bow.&nbsp; She paid her four-and-sixpence a week to
take care of the child.&nbsp; She never saw more than two other
babies at Mrs. Savill&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; She thought her child
was thoroughly attended to.&nbsp; The deceased met with an
accident and its thigh was broken, but the doctor said that the
witness need not put herself out in the slightest degree, for the
child was getting on very well.&nbsp; Witness could not get away
from business more than once a week to see the child.&nbsp; She
had not seen the child for five weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Caroline Savill said she was the wife of a porter
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>in the
city.&nbsp; The deceased had been with her ten months.&nbsp; She
put him to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock on Saturday night, and at
half-past eight on Sunday morning she said to her daughter,
&lsquo;He looks strange,&rsquo; and then she put a looking-glass
to his mouth and found that he was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Coroner: She could account for the broken
thigh.&nbsp; Last October when she was taking deceased up to bed,
she slipped down and fell upon the child.&nbsp; She was quite
certain that she was sober.&nbsp; It was a pair of old boots that
caused her to slip.&nbsp; She had eleven children to keep at
Bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Juryman: You keep, in fact, a baby-farm?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witness: That I must leave to your generosity,
gentlemen.&nbsp; In continuation, witness stated that out of the
eleven children <i>five had died</i>.&nbsp; There had been no
inquest on either of them.&nbsp; The deceased&rsquo;s bed was an
egg-box with some straw in it.&nbsp; The egg-box was a short one,
and was sixteen inches wide.&nbsp; The child could not turn in
it.&nbsp; She never tied deceased&rsquo;s legs together.&nbsp;
She never discovered that the child&rsquo;s thigh was broken till
the morning following the night when she fell on it.&nbsp; He
cried and she put him to bed.&nbsp; She fell upon the edge of the
stairs and her weight was on him.&nbsp; She sent for a doctor
next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Atkins said he was called to see the dead body
of the deceased last Sunday.&nbsp; The child had a malformed
chest.&nbsp; Death had arisen from effusion of serum on the brain
from natural causes, and not from neglect.&nbsp; Witness had
attended the deceased for the broken thigh.&nbsp; He believed
that the bones had not united when death took place.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;The jury, after a long consultation, returned a
verdict of &lsquo;death from natural causes;&rsquo; and they
wished to append a censure, but the coroner refused to record
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the whole of the pretty story of which the reader must
be left to form his own opinion.&nbsp; Should that opinion insist
on a censure as one of its appendages, the reader must of course
be held personally responsible for it.&nbsp; It is all over
now.&nbsp; The poor little victim whom a Miss of his name placed
with the Bow &ldquo;child-farmer,&rdquo; &ldquo;by leave of your
generosity, gentlemen,&rdquo; is dead and buried.&nbsp; It would
have been a mercy when his unsteady nurse fell on and crushed him
on the edge of the stairs, if she had crushed his miserable life
out, instead of only breaking a thigh.&nbsp; Since last October,
with one small leg literally in the grave, he must have had a
dismal time of it, poor little chap, and glad, indeed, must his
spirit have been when its clay tenement was lifted out of his
coffin cradle&mdash;the egg-box with the bit of straw in
it&mdash;and consigned to the peaceful little wooden house that
the cemetery claimed.&nbsp; It is all over with Frederick John
Wood; and his mamma, or whoever he was who was at liberty only
once a week to come and see him, is released from the crushing
burden his maintenance imposed on her, and Mrs. Savill by this
time has doubtless filled up the egg-box the little boy&rsquo;s
demise rendered vacant.&nbsp; Why should she not, when she left
the coroner&rsquo;s court without a stain on her character?&nbsp;
It is all over.&nbsp; The curtain that was raised just a little
has been dropped again, and the audience has dispersed, and
nobody will think again of the tragedy the darkened stage is
ready to <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>produce again at the shortest notice, until the
coroner&rsquo;s constable rings the bell and the curtain once
more ascends.</p>
<p>And so we shall go on, unless the law steps in to our
aid.&nbsp; Why does it not do so?&nbsp; It is stringent and
vigilant enough as regards inferior animals.&nbsp; It has a stern
eye for pigs, and will not permit them to be kept except on
certain inflexible conditions.&nbsp; It holds dogs in leash, and
permits them to live only as contributors to Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Inland Revenue.&nbsp; It holds its whip over lodging-house
keepers, and under frightful pains and penalties they may not
swindle a lodger of one out of his several hundred regulation
feet of air; but it takes no heed of the cries of its persecuted
babes and sucklings.&nbsp; Anyone may start as a professed
adopter of children.&nbsp; Anyone however ignorant, and brutal,
and given to slipping down stairs, may start as a baby-farmer,
with liberty to do as she pleases with the helpless creatures
placed in her charge.&nbsp; What she pleases first of all to do,
as a matter of course, is to pare down the cost of her
charge&rsquo;s keep, so that she may make a living of the
parings.&nbsp; As has been seen, she need not even find them beds
to lie on; if she be extra economical, an egg-box with a handful
of straw will do as well.</p>
<p>And is there no remedy for this?&nbsp; Would it not be
possible, at least, to issue licences to baby-keepers as they are
at present issued to cow-keepers?&nbsp; It may appear a brutal
way of putting the matter, but it becomes less so when one
considers how much at present the brutes have the best of it.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">WORKING BOYS.</span></h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The London Errand Boy</i>.&mdash;<i>His
Drudgery and Privations</i>.&mdash;<i>His
Temptations</i>.&mdash;<i>The London Boy after
Dark</i>.&mdash;<i>The Amusements provided for him</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> law takes account of but two
phases of human existence,&mdash;the child irresponsible, and the
adult responsible, and overlooks as beneath its dignity the
important and well-marked steps that lead from the former state
to the latter.</p>
<p>Despite the illegality of the proceeding, it is the intention
of the writer hereof to do otherwise, aware as he is, and as
every thinking person may be, of how critical and all-important a
period in the career of the male human creature, is
&ldquo;boyhood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amongst people of means and
education, the grave responsibility of seeing their rising
progeny safely through the perilous &ldquo;middle passage&rdquo;
is fully recognized; but it is sadly different with the labouring
classes, and the very poor.</p>
<p>It is a lamentable fact that at that period of his existence
when he needs closest watching, when he stands in need of
healthful guidance, of counsel against temptation, a boy, the son
of labouring parents, is left to himself, almost free to follow
the dictates of his inclinations, be <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>they good or had.&nbsp; Nothing than
this can be more injudicious, and as regards the boy&rsquo;s
moral culture and worldly welfare, more unjust.&nbsp; Not, as I
would have it distinctly understood, that the boy of vulgar
breeding is by nature more pregnable to temptation than his same
age brother of genteel extraction; not because, fairly tested
with the latter, he would be the first to succumb to a
temptation, but because, poor fellow, outward circumstances press
and hamper him so unfairly.</p>
<p>It has recently come to my knowledge that at the present time
there is striving hard to attract public attention and patronage
an institution styled the &ldquo;Errand Boys&rsquo;
Home.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be difficult, indeed, to overrate the
importance of such an establishment, properly conducted.&nbsp;
Amongst neglected children of a larger growth, those of the
familiar &ldquo;errand boy&rdquo; type figure first and
foremost.&nbsp; It would be instructive to learn how many boys of
the kind indicated are annually drafted into our great criminal
army, and still more so to trace back the swift downhill strides
to the original little faltering step that shuffled from the
right path to the wrong.</p>
<p>Anyone who has any acquaintance with the habits and customs of
the labouring classes, must be aware that the
&ldquo;family&rdquo; system is for the younger branches, as they
grow up, to elbow those just above them in age out into the
world; not only to make more room at the dinner-table, but to
assist in its substantial adornment.&nbsp; The poorer the family,
the earlier the boys are turned out, &ldquo;to cut their own
grass,&rdquo; as the saying is.&nbsp; Take a case&mdash;<a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>one in ten
thousand&mdash;to be met with to-morrow or any day in the city of
London.&nbsp; Tom is a little lad&mdash;one of seven or
eight&mdash;his father is a labourer, earning, say, a guinea a
week; and from the age of seven Tom has been sent to a
penny-a-week school; partly for the sake of what learning he may
chance to pick up, but chiefly to keep him &ldquo;out of the
streets,&rdquo; and to effect a simultaneous saving of his morals
and of his shoe-leather.&nbsp; As before stated, Tom&rsquo;s is
essentially a working family.&nbsp; It is Tom&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s pride to relate how that he was &ldquo;turned
out&rdquo; at eight, and had to trudge through the snow to work
at six o&rsquo;clock of winter mornings; and, that though on
account of coughs and chilblains and other frivolous and childish
ailments, he thought it very hard at the time, he rejoices that
he was so put to it, since he has no doubt that it tended to
harden him and make him the man he is.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when Tom has reached the ripe age of ten, it is
accounted high time that he &ldquo;got a place,&rdquo; as did his
father before him; and, as there are a hundred ways in London in
which a sharp little boy of ten can be made useful, very little
difficulty is experienced in Tom&rsquo;s launching.&nbsp; He
becomes an &ldquo;errand boy,&rdquo; a newspaper or a printing
boy, in all probability.&nbsp; The reader curious as to the
employment of juvenile labour, may any morning at six or seven
o&rsquo;clock in the morning witness the hurried trudging to work
of as many Toms as the pavement of our great highways will
conveniently accommodate, each with his small bundle of food in a
little bag, to last him the day through.&nbsp; Something <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>else he may
see, too, that would be highly comic were it not for its pitiful
side.&nbsp; As need not be repeated here, a boy&rsquo;s estimate
of earthly bliss might be conveniently contained in a
dinner-plate of goodly dimensions.&nbsp; When he first goes out
to work, his pride and glory is the parcel of food his mother
makes up for the day&rsquo;s consumption.&nbsp; There he has
it&mdash;breakfast, dinner, tea!&nbsp; Possibly he might get as
much, or very nearly, in the ordinary course of events at home,
but in a piece-meal and ignoble way.&nbsp; He never in his life
possessed such a wealth of food, all his own, to do as he pleases
with.&nbsp; Eight&mdash;ten slices of bread and butter, and may
be&mdash;especially if it happen to be Monday&mdash;a slice of
meat and a lump of cold pudding; relics of that dinner of
dinners, Sunday&rsquo;s dinner!</p>
<p>His, all his, with nobody to say nay; but still only wealth in
prospective!&nbsp; It is now barely seven o&rsquo;clock, and, by
fair eating, he will not arrive at that delicious piece of cold
pork with the crackling on it until twelve!&nbsp; It is a keen,
bracing morning; he has already walked a mile or more; and it
wants yet fully an hour and a half to the factory breakfast
time.&nbsp; It is just as broad as it is long; suppose he draws
on his breakfast allowance just to the extent of one slice?&nbsp;
Only one, and that in stern integrity: the topmost slice without
fee or favour!&nbsp; But, ah! the cruel fragrance of that juicy
cut of spare-rib!&nbsp; It has impregnated the whole contents of
the bundle.&nbsp; The crust of that abstracted slice is as
savoury, almost, as the crisp-baked rind of the original.&nbsp;
Six bites&mdash;&ldquo;too brief for friendship, not for
fame&rdquo;&mdash;have consumed it, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and left him, alas! hungrier than
ever.&nbsp; Shall he?&nbsp; What&mdash;taste of the sacred
slice?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t likely.&nbsp; The pork is
for his dinner.&nbsp; But the pudding&mdash;that is a
supplemental sort of article; a mere extravagance when added to
so much perfection as the luscious meat embodies.&nbsp; And out
he hauls it; the ponderous abstraction afflicting the hitherto
compact parcel with such a shambling looseness, that it is
necessary to pause in one of the recesses of the bridge to
readjust and tighten it.&nbsp; But, ah! rash boy!&nbsp; Since
thou wert not proof against the temptation lurking in that slice
of bread-and-butter, but faintly odorous of that maddening
flavour, how canst thou hope to save thyself now that thou hast
tasted of the pudding to which the pork was wedded in the
baker&rsquo;s oven?&nbsp; It were as safe to trust thee at hungry
noon with a luscious apple-dumpling, and bid thee eat of the
dough and leave the fruit.&nbsp; It is all over.&nbsp; Reason,
discretion, the admonitions of a troubled conscience, were all
gulped down with that last corner, crusty bit, so full of
gravy.&nbsp; The bridge&rsquo;s next recess is the scene of
another halt, and of an utterly reckless spoliation of the
dwindled bundle.&nbsp; And now the pork is consumed, to the
veriest atom, and nought remains but four reproachful bread
slices, that skulk in a corner, and almost demand the untimely
fate visited on their companions.&nbsp; Shall they crave in
vain?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; A pretty bundle, <i>this</i>, to take to
the factory for his mates to see.&nbsp; A good excuse will serve
his purpose better.&nbsp; He will engulf the four slices as he
did the rest, and fold up his bag neatly, and hide it in his
pocket, and, when dinner-time comes, he will profess that there
is something <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>nice at home, and he is going there to partake of it;
while, really, he will take a dismal stroll, lamenting his early
weakness, and making desperate vows for the future.</p>
<p>It is not, however, with Tom as the lucky owner of a filled
food-bag that we have here to deal, but with Tom who at least
five days out of the six is packed off to work with just as much
bread and butter as his poor mother can spare off the family
loaf.&nbsp; Now &ldquo;going out to work&rdquo; is a vastly
different matter from going from home to school, and innocently
playing between whiles.&nbsp; In the first place, the real hard
work he has to perform (and few people would readily believe the
enormous amount of muscular exertion these little fellows are
capable of enduring), develops his appetite for eating to a
prodigious extent.&nbsp; He finds the food he brings from home as
his daily ration but half sufficient.&nbsp; What are a couple of
slices of bread, with perhaps a morsel of cheese, considered as a
dinner for a hearty boy who has perhaps trudged from post to
pillar a dozen miles or so since his breakfast, carrying loads
more or less heavy?&nbsp; He hungers for more, and more is
constantly in his sight if he only had the means, a penny or
twopence even, to buy it.&nbsp; He makes the acquaintance of
other boys; he is drawn towards them in hungry, envious
curiosity, seeing them in the enjoyment of what he so yearns
after, and they speedily inform him how easy it is to
&ldquo;make&rdquo; not only a penny or twopence, but a sixpence
or a shilling, if he has a mind.&nbsp; And they are quite right,
these young counsellors of evil.&nbsp; The facilities for petty
pilfering afforded to the shopkeeper&rsquo;s errand-boy are such
as favour momentary <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>evil impulses.&nbsp; He need not engage in subtle plans
for the purloining of a shilling or a shilling&rsquo;s
worth.&nbsp; The opportunity is at his fingers&rsquo; ends
constantly.&nbsp; Usually he has the range of the business
premises.&nbsp; Few people mistrust a little boy, and he is left
to mind the shop where the money-till is, and he has free access
to the store-room or warehouse in which all manner of portable
small goods are heaped in profusion.&nbsp; It is an awful
temptation.&nbsp; It is not sufficient to urge that it should not
be, and that in the case of a lad of well-regulated mind it would
not be.&nbsp; It would perhaps be more to the purpose to
substitute &ldquo;well-regulated meals&rdquo; for
&ldquo;well-regulated minds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nine times out of ten
the confessions of a discovered juvenile pilferer go to prove
that he sinned for his belly&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He has no
conscience above his waistband, poor little wretch; nor can much
better be expected, when we consider that all his life, his
experience and observation has taught him that the first grand
aim of human ingenuity and industry is to place a hot baked
dinner on the table of Sundays.&nbsp; To be sure, in the case of
his hardworking father he may never have known him resort to any
other than honest industry; he never found out that his parent
was any other than an honest man; and so long as his father or
his employer does not find him out to be any other than an honest
boy, matters may run smoothly.</p>
<p>It is least of all my intention to make out that every
errand-boy is a petty thief; all that I maintain is that he is a
human creature just budding into existence as it were in the
broad furrowed field of life, and that his susceptibilities are
tender, and should be protected from evil influence <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>with even
extraordinary care; and that instead of which he is but too often
left to grow up as maybe.&nbsp; In their ignorance and hard
driving necessity, his parents having given him a spell of penny
schooling, and maintained him until he has become a marketable
article, persuade themselves that they have done for him the best
they can, and nothing remains but for him to obey his master in
all things, and he will grow to be as bright a man as his father
before him.</p>
<p>It is only necessary to point to the large number of such
children, for they are no better, who annually swell our criminal
lists, to prove that somewhere a screw is sadly loose, and that
the sooner it is set right the better it will be for the
nation.&nbsp; The Home for Errand Boys is the best scheme that
has as yet been put forth towards meeting the difficulty.&nbsp;
Its professed object, I believe, is to afford shelter and
wholesome food and healthful and harmless recreation for boys who
are virtually without a home, and who have &ldquo;only a
lodging.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is to say, a place to which they may
retire to sleep come bed-time, and for which they pay what
appears as a paltry sum when regarded as so many pence per night,
but which tells up to a considerable sum by the end of a
week.</p>
<p>The most important feature, however, of such a scheme as the
Home for Errand Boys embraces, does not appear in the vaunted
advantage of reduced cost.&nbsp; Its main attraction is the
promise it holds out to provide its lodgers with suitable
amusement after work hours and before bed-time.&nbsp; If this
were done on an extensive scale, there is no telling how much
real substantial good might be accomplished.&nbsp; <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>It is after
work hours that boys fall into mischief.&nbsp; There is no reason
why these homes should not have existence in various parts of
London.&nbsp; One such establishment indeed is of little
practical use.&nbsp; If it were possible to establish such places
(a careful avoidance of everything savouring of the
&ldquo;asylum&rdquo; and the &ldquo;reformatory&rdquo; would of
course be necessary) in half a dozen different spots in the
immediate neighbourhood of the city, they would doubtless meet
with extensive patronage.&nbsp; They might indeed be made to
serve many valuable ends that do not appear at a first
glance.&nbsp; If these &ldquo;homes&rdquo; were established east,
west, north, and south, they might be all under one management,
and much good be effected by recommending deserving members for
employment.&nbsp; There might even be a provident fund, formed by
contributions of a penny or so a week, out of which lads
unavoidably out of employ could be supported until a job of work
was found for them.</p>
<p>Allusion has, in a previous page, been made to that dangerous
time for working boys&mdash;the time between leaving work and
retiring to bed.&nbsp; It would be bad enough were the boy left
to his own devices for squandering his idle time and his
hard-earned pence.&nbsp; This task, however, is taken out of his
hands.&nbsp; He has only to stroll up this street and down the
next, and he will find pitfalls already dug for him; neatly and
skilfully dug, and so prettily overspread with cosy carpeting,
that they do not in the least appear like pitfalls.&nbsp; It may
at first sight seem that &ldquo;neglected children&rdquo; are
least of all likely to make it worth the while of these diggers
of pits, but it <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>should be borne in mind that the term in question is
here applied in its most comprehensive sense, that there are
children of all ages, and that there are many more ways than one
of neglecting children.&nbsp; It is evident that young boys who
are out at work from six till six say, and after that spend the
evening pretty much how they please, are &ldquo;neglected&rdquo;
in the most emphatic meaning of the term.&nbsp; Parents are not
apt to think so.&nbsp; It is little that they have to concede him
in return for his contributions to the common stock, and probably
they regard this laxity of supervision as the working boy&rsquo;s
due&mdash;as something he has earned, and which is his by
right.&nbsp; The boy himself is nothing backward in claiming a
privilege he sees accorded to so many other boys, and it is the
least troublesome thing in the world for the parents to grant the
favour.&nbsp; All that they stipulate for is that the boy shall
be home and a-bed in such good time as shall enable him to be up
and at work without the loss in the morning of so much as an
hour; which is a loss of just as many pence as may happen.</p>
<p>It may not be here out of place to make more definite allusion
to the &ldquo;pitfalls&rdquo; above-mentioned.&nbsp; Pitfall
broadest and deepest is the theatrical exhibition, known as the
&ldquo;penny gaff.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some considerable time since I
wrote on this subject in the columns of the &ldquo;Morning
Star;&rdquo; and as precisely the old order of things prevails,
and the arguments then used against them apply with equal force
now, I will, with the reader&rsquo;s permission, save myself
further trouble than that which transcription involves.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Every
low district of London has its theatre, or at least an humble
substitute for one, called in vulgar parlance a
&ldquo;gaff.&rdquo;&nbsp; A gaff is a place in which, according
to the strict interpretation of the term, stage plays may not be
represented.&nbsp; The actors of a drama may not correspond in
colloquy, only in pantomime, but the pieces brought out at the
&ldquo;gaff&rdquo; are seldom of an intricate character, and the
not over-fastidious auditory are well content with an exhibition
of dumb show and gesture, that even the dullest comprehension may
understand.&nbsp; The prices of admission to these modest temples
of the tragic muse, are judiciously regulated to the means of the
neighbourhood, and range from a penny to threepence.&nbsp; There
is no &ldquo;half-price for children,&rdquo; and for the simple
reason that such an arrangement would reduce the takings exactly
fifty per cent.&nbsp; They are <i>all</i> children who support
the gaff.&nbsp; Costermonger boys and girls, from eight or nine
to fourteen years old, and errand boys and girls employed at
factories.&nbsp; As before mentioned, every district has its own
&ldquo;gaff.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is one near Peter Street,
Westminster; a second in the New Cut, at Lambeth; a third in
Whitecross Street; a fourth, fifth, and sixth between Whitechapel
Church and Ratcliff Highway.&nbsp; It may, without fear of
contradiction, be asserted, that within a circuit of five miles
of St. Paul&rsquo;s, at least twenty of these dangerous dens of
amusement might be enumerated.</p>
<p>At best of times they are dangerous.&nbsp; The best of times
being when current topics of a highly sensational character are
lacking, and the enterprising manager is compelled <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>to fall back
on some comparatively harmless stock piece.&nbsp; But the
&ldquo;gaff&rdquo; proprietor has an eye to business, and is a
man unlikely to allow what he regards as his chances to slip by
him.&nbsp; He at once perceives a chance in the modern mania that
pervades the juvenile population for a class of literature
commonly known as &ldquo;highly sensational.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has
no literature to vend, but he does not despair on that
account.&nbsp; He is aware that not one in five of the youth who
honour his establishment with their patronage can read.&nbsp; If
he, the worthy gaff proprietor, had any doubts on the subject, he
might settle them any day by listening at his door while an
admiring crowd of &ldquo;regular customers&rdquo; flocking
thereto speculated on the pleasures of the night as foretold in
glowing colours on the immense placards that adorn the exterior
of his little theatre.&nbsp; They can understand the pictures
well enough, but the descriptive legends beneath them are
mysteries to which few possess the key.&nbsp; If these few are
maliciously reticent, the despair of the benighted ones is
painful to witness, as with puckered mouths and knitted brows
they essay to decipher the strange straight and crooked
characters, and earnestly consult with each other as to when and
where they had seen the like.&nbsp; Failing in this, the gaff
proprietor may have heard them exclaim in tones of but
half-assured consolation, &ldquo;Ah, well! it doesn&rsquo;t
matter what the <i>reading</i> is; the piece won&rsquo;t be
spoke, it&rsquo;ll be <i>acted</i>, so we are sure to know all
about it when we come to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it is easy enough to understand the
agonized anxiety of low-lived ignorant Master <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Tomkins in
these stirring times of Black Highwaymen, and Spring Heel Jacks,
and Boy Detectives.&nbsp; In the shop window of the newsvendor
round the corner, he sees displayed all in a row, a long line of
&ldquo;penny numbers,&rdquo; the mere illustrations pertaining to
which makes his heart palpitate, and his hair stir beneath his
ragged cap.&nbsp; There he sees bold highwaymen busy at every
branch of their delightful avocation, stopping a lonely traveller
and pressing a pistol barrel to his affrighted head, and bidding
him deliver his money or his life; or impeding the way of the
mail coach, the captain, hat in hand, courteously robbing the
inside passengers (prominent amongst whom is a magnificent female
with a low bodice, who evidently is not insensible to the
captain&rsquo;s fascinating manner), while members of his gang
are seen in murderous conflict with the coachman and the guard,
whose doom is but too surely foreshadowed.&nbsp; Again, here is a
spirited woodcut of a booted and spurred highwayman in headlong
flight from pursuing Bow Street officers who are close at his
heels, and in no way daunted or hurt by the contents of the brace
of pistols the fugitive has manifestly just discharged point
blank at their heads.</p>
<p>But fairly in the way of the bold rider is a toll-gate, and in
a state of wild excitement the toll-gate keeper is seen grasping
the long bar that crosses the road.&nbsp; The tormenting question
at once arises in the mind of Master Tomkins&mdash;is he pushing
it or pulling it?&nbsp; Is he friendly to the Black Knight of the
Road or is he not?&nbsp; Master T. feels that his hero&rsquo;s
fate is in that toll-gate <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>man&rsquo;s hands; he doesn&rsquo;t
know if he should vastly admire him or regard him with the
deadliest enmity.&nbsp; From the bottom of his heart he hopes
that the toll-gate man may be friendly.&nbsp; He would cheerfully
give up the only penny he has in his pocket to know that it were
so.&nbsp; He would give a penny for a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no,&rdquo; and all the while there are eight good
letter-press pages along with the picture that would tell him all
about it if he only were able to read!&nbsp; There is a scowl on
his young face as he reflects on this, and bitterly he thinks of
his hardhearted father who sent him out to sell fusees when he
should have been at school learning his A B C.&nbsp; Truly, he
went for a short time to a Ragged School, but there the master
kept all the jolly books to himself&mdash;the &ldquo;Knight of
the Road&rdquo; and that sort of thing, and gave him to learn out
of a lot of sober dry rubbish without the least flavour in
it.&nbsp; Who says that he is a dunce and won&rsquo;t
learn?&nbsp; Try him now.&nbsp; Buy a few numbers of the
&ldquo;Knight of the Road&rdquo; and sit down with him, and make
him spell out every word of it.&nbsp; Never was boy so anxious
after knowledge.&nbsp; He never picked a pocket yet, but such is
his present desperate spirit, that if he had the chance of
picking the art of reading out of one, just see if he
wouldn&rsquo;t precious soon make himself a scholar?</p>
<p>Thus it is with the neglected boy, blankly illiterate.&nbsp;
It need not be supposed, however, that a simple and quiet perusal
of the astounding adventures of his gallows heroes from the
printed text would completely satisfy the boy with sufficient
knowledge to enable him to spell <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>through a &ldquo;penny
number.&rdquo;&nbsp; It whets his appetite merely.&nbsp; It is
one thing to <i>read</i> about the flashing and slashing of steel
blades, and of the gleam of pistol barrels, and the whiz of
bullets, and of the bold highwayman&rsquo;s defiant &ldquo;ha!
ha!&rdquo; as he cracks the skull of the coach-guard, preparatory
to robbing the affrighted passengers; but to be satisfactory the
marrow and essence of the blood-stirring tragedy can only be
conveyed to him in bodily shape.&nbsp; There are many elements of
a sanguinary drama that may not well be expressed in words.&nbsp;
As, for instance, when Bill Bludjon, after having cut the throat
of the gentleman passenger, proceeds to rob his daughter, and
finding her in possession of a locket with some grey hair in it,
he returns it to her with the observation, &ldquo;Nay, fair lady,
Bill Bludjon may be a thief: in stern defence of self he may
occasionally shed blood, but, Perish the Liar who says of him
that he respects not the grey hairs of honourable
age!&rdquo;&nbsp; There is not much in this as set down in
print.&nbsp; To do Bill justice, you must see how his noble
countenance lights as his generous bosom heaves with chivalrous
sentiments; how defiantly he scowls, and grinds his indignant
teeth as he hisses the word &ldquo;<i>Liar</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;how
piously he turns his eyes heavenward as he alludes to
&ldquo;honourable old age.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in these emotional
subtleties that the hero rises out of the vulgar robber with his
villanous Whitechapel cast of countenance, and his great hands,
hideous with murder stains, must be witnessed to be
appreciated.&nbsp; It is the gaff proprietor&rsquo;s high aim and
ambition to effect this laudable object, and that he does so with
a considerable <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>amount of, at least, pecuniary success, is proved by his
&ldquo;crowded houses&rdquo; nightly.</p>
<p>Now that the police are to be roused to increased vigilance in
the suppression, as well as the arrest of criminality, it would
be as well if those in authority directed their especial
attention to these penny theatres.&nbsp; As they at present
exist, they are nothing better than hot-beds of vice in its
vilest forms.&nbsp; Girls and boys of tender age are herded
together to witness the splendid achievements of &ldquo;dashing
highwaymen,&rdquo; and of sirens of the Starlight Sall school;
nor is this all.&nbsp; But bad as this is, it is really the least
part of the evil.&nbsp; The penny &ldquo;gaff&rdquo; is usually a
small place, and when a specially atrocious piece produces a
corresponding &ldquo;run,&rdquo; the &ldquo;house&rdquo; is
incapable of containing the vast number of boys and girls who
nightly flock to see it.&nbsp; Scores would be turned away from
the doors, and their halfpence wasted, were it not for the worthy
proprietor&rsquo;s ingenuity.&nbsp; I am now speaking of what I
was an actual witness of in the neighbourhood of
Shoreditch.&nbsp; Beneath the pit and stage of the theatre was a
sort of large kitchen, reached from the end of the passage, that
was the entrance to the theatre by a flight of steep
stairs.&nbsp; There were no seats in this kitchen, nor furniture
of any kind.&nbsp; There was a window looking toward the street,
but this was prudently boarded up.&nbsp; At night time all the
light allowed in the kitchen proceeded from a feeble and dim gas
jet by the wall over the fire-place.</p>
<p>Wretched and dreary-looking as was this underground chamber,
it was a source of considerable profit to the <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>proprietor of
the &ldquo;gaff&rdquo; overhead.&nbsp; As before stated, when
anything peculiarly attractive was to be seen, the theatre filled
within ten minutes of opening the besieged doors.&nbsp; Not to
disappoint the late comers, however, all who pleased might pay
and go downstairs until the performance just commenced (it lasted
generally about an hour and a half) terminated.&nbsp; The prime
inducement held out was, that &ldquo;then they would be sure of
good seats.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inevitable result of such an
arrangement may be easier guessed than described.&nbsp; For my
part, I know no more about it than was to be derived from a hasty
glance from the stair-head.&nbsp; There was a stench of tobacco
smoke, and an uproar of mingled youthful voices&mdash;swearing,
chaffing, and screaming, in boisterous mirth.&nbsp; This was all
that was to be heard, the Babel charitably rendering distinct
pronouncing of blasphemy or indecency unintelligible.&nbsp; Nor
was it much easier to make out the source from whence the hideous
clamour proceeded, for the kitchen was dim as a coal cellar, and
was further obscured by the foul tobacco smoke the lads were
emitting from their short pipes.&nbsp; A few were romping
about&mdash;&ldquo;larking,&rdquo; as it is termed&mdash;but the
majority, girls and boys, were squatted on the floor, telling and
listening to stories, the quality of which might but too truly be
guessed from the sort of applause they elicited.&nbsp; A
few&mdash;impatient of the frivolity that surrounded them, and
really anxious for &ldquo;the play&rdquo;&mdash;stood apart,
gazing with scowling envy up at the ceiling, on the upper side of
which, at frequent intervals, there was a furious clatter of
hobnailed boots, betokening <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the delirious delight of the happy
audience in full view of Starlight Sall, in &ldquo;silk
tights&rdquo; and Hessians, dancing a Highland fling.&nbsp;
Goaded to desperation, one or two of the tormented ones down in
the kitchen reached up with their sticks and beat on the ceiling
a tattoo, responsive to the battering of the hobnailed boots
before mentioned.&nbsp; This, however, was a breach of
&ldquo;gaff&rdquo; rule that could not be tolerated.&nbsp; With
hurried steps the proprietor approached the kitchen stairs, and
descried me.&nbsp; &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t the theeater;
you&rsquo;ve no business here, sir!&rdquo; said he, in some
confusion, as I imagined.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, my friend, I have no
business here, but <i>you</i> have a very pretty business, and
one for which, when comes the Great Day of Reckoning, I would
rather you answered than me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I only thought
this; aloud, I made the gaff proprietor an apology, and
thankfully got off his abominable premises.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE PROBLEM OF DELIVERANCE.</span></h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Curious Problem</i>.&mdash;<i>The Best
Method of Treatment</i>.&mdash;<i>The</i> &ldquo;<i>Child of the
Gutter</i>&rdquo; <i>not to be Entirely
Abolished</i>.&mdash;<i>The Genuine Alley-Bred
Arab</i>.&mdash;<i>The Poor Lambs of the Ragged
Flock</i>.&mdash;<i>The Tree of Evil in Our
Midst</i>.&mdash;<i>The Breeding Places of Disease and
Vice</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> curious
problem&mdash;&ldquo;What is the best method of treatment to
adopt towards improving the condition of neglected children, and
to diminish their number for the future?&rdquo; has been
attempted for solution from so many points of attack, and by
means so various, that a bare enumeration of the instances would
occupy much more space than these limited pages afford.</p>
<p>We may never hope entirely to abolish the child of the
gutter.&nbsp; To a large extent, as has been shown, he is a
natural growth of vices that seem inseparable from our social
system: he is of the world, the flesh, and the devil; and, until
we purge our grosser nature, and become angelic, we must tolerate
him as we must the result of all our ill-breeding.&nbsp; It is a
thousand pities that it should be so, because, as I have
endeavoured in these pages to show, the neglected child issuing
from the source here hinted at, is by far the most unmanageable
and dangerous.&nbsp; Blood is thicker than any water, not
excluding ditch water; and the chances are that the <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>unlucky
&ldquo;love-child&rdquo; will not remain content to grovel in the
kennel to which an accident of birth consigned him, but, out of
his rebellious nature, conceive a deadly hatred against the world
that has served him so shabbily, and do his best to be revenged
on it.&nbsp; It is not of the neglected child of this breed that
I would say a few concluding words, but of the genuine alley-bred
Arab of the City; the worthy descendant of a tribe that has grown
so used to neglect that it regards it as its privilege, and
fiercely resents any move that may be taken towards its
curtailment.</p>
<p>If ever a distressed creature had friends surely this one
has.&nbsp; From time immemorial it has been the pet of the
philanthropist.&nbsp; Unsavoury, unsightly bantling as it is, he
is never tired of fondling it, spending his time and money over
it, and holding it up to the commiseration of a humane public,
and building all manner of homes and asylums for it; but he still
remains on hand.&nbsp; If he would grow up, and after being bound
&rsquo;prentice to a wholesome trade cease to trouble us, there
would be some satisfaction in the business; but it never grows
up.&nbsp; It is like the borrowed beggar&rsquo;s brat, that, in
defiance of the progress of time, never emerges from its bedgown,
and never grows too big to be tucked under one arm, leaving the
other at liberty to arrest the charitable passer-by.</p>
<p>To be sure it is a great consolation to know that despite our
non-success, the poor little object of our solicitude is in no
danger of being dropped in hopelessness and abandoned, but it
would be encouraging to discover that we were making some
progress with our main design, <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>which can be nothing less than the
complete extinction of children of the &ldquo;gutter&rdquo;
tribe, such as we are now discussing.</p>
<p>As it is, we are making scarcely any progress at all.&nbsp; I
am aware that statistics are against this statement, that the
triumphant reports of this and that charity point to a different
conclusion.&nbsp; This home has rescued so many little ones from
the streets&mdash;that asylum can show a thousand decently clad
and educated children that but for its efforts would at this
moment be either prowling the streets, picking up a more
precarious living than the stray dog picks up, or leading the
life of a petty thief, and rapidly earning his right to penal
servitude.</p>
<p>This, and much more, is doubtless true, but there remains the
grim fact that our filthy byways still swarm with these dirty,
ragged, disease-stricken little ones, and as plentifully as of
yore they infest our highways, an eyesore and a shuddering to all
decent beholders.&nbsp; If there has occurred any recent
diminution in their number, I should rejoice to know it; but that
such is in the least degree the fact, certainly I am not
justified in assuming in the face of the urgent appeals daily put
forth by the wise in such matters, and who never tire of urging
on the benevolently disposed, that never was there such need as
now to be up and stirring.</p>
<p>And it can never be otherwise while we limit our charitable
doing to providing for those poor lambs of the ragged flock as
fast as they are bred, and cast loose on the chance of their
being mercifully kidnapped and taken care of.&nbsp; As with
indiscriminate giving to beggars, it <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>may be urged that we can never go
wrong in ministering to the distress of the infantine and
helpless.&nbsp; Opportunities of doing so should perhaps be
joyfully hailed by us as affording wholesome exercise of our
belief in the Christian religion, but we may rely on it that the
supply of the essential ingredient towards the said exercise will
never be unequal to the demand.&nbsp; Our charitable exertion
flows in too narrow a channel.&nbsp; It is pure, and of depth
immeasurable, but it is not broad enough.&nbsp; We have got into
a habit of treating our neglected children as an evil
unavoidable, and one that must be endured with kindly and pious
resignation.&nbsp; We have a gigantic tree of evil rooted in our
midst, and our great care is to collect the ripe seeds it drops
and provide against their germinating, and we expend as much time
and money in the process as judiciously applied would serve to
tear up the old tree from its tenacious holding, and for ever
destroy its mischievous power.&nbsp; No doubt it may be justly
claimed by the patrons and supporters of homes and asylums, that
by rescuing these children from the streets they are saved from
becoming debased and demoralized as were the parents they sprang
from, and so, in course of time, by a steady perseverance in
their system, the breed of gutter prowlers must become extinct;
but that is a tedious and roundabout method of reform that can
only be tolerated until a more direct route is discovered, and
one that can scarcely prove satisfactory to those who look
forward to a lifetime return for some of their invested
capital.</p>
<p>We may depend on it that we shall never make much <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>real progress
in our endeavours to check the growth of these seedlings and
offshoots of ragged poverty and reckless squalor until we turn
our attention with a settled purpose to the haunts they are bred
in.&nbsp; Our present system compels us even in its first
preliminary steps to do violence against nature.&nbsp; We cannot
deal with our babies of the gutter effectually, and with any
reasonable chance of success, until we have separated them
entirely from their <i>home</i>.&nbsp; We may tame them and teach
them to feed out of our hands, and to repeat after us the
alphabet, and even words of two and three syllables.&nbsp; We may
even induce them to shed their bedraggled feathers and adopt a
more decent plumage; but they can never be other than restless
and ungovernable, and unclean birds, while they inhabit the vile
old parent nest.</p>
<p>It is these vile old nests that should be abolished.&nbsp;
While they are permitted to exist, while Rosemary Lane, and Peter
Street, Westminster, and Back Church Lane in Whitechapel, and Cow
Cross and Seven Dials, and a hundred similar places are tolerated
and allowed to flourish, it is utterly impossible to diminish the
race of children of the gutter.&nbsp; Why should these breeding
places of disease and vice and all manner of abomination be
permitted to cumber the earth?&nbsp; There is but one opinion
that these horrid dens are the sources from which are derived
two-thirds of our neglected ragged urchin population.&nbsp;
Further, it is generally conceded, that it is not because of the
prevalence of extreme poverty there; the filthy little
public-houses invariably to be found lurking in the neighbourhood
of rags and squalor would <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>not be so prosperous if such were the
case.&nbsp; It is the pestilential atmosphere of the place that
will let nothing good live in it.&nbsp; You may never purify
it.&nbsp; It is altogether a rotten carcase; and if you stuff it
to the mouth with chloride of lime, and whitewash it an inch
thick, you will make nothing else of it.&nbsp; It is a sin and a
disgrace that human creatures should be permitted to herd in such
places.&nbsp; One and all should be abolished, and wholesome
habitations built in their stead.&nbsp; Half measures will not
meet the case.&nbsp; That has been sufficiently proved but
recently, when, not for morality or decency sake, but to make
room for a railway, a few score of these odious hole-and-corner
&ldquo;slums&rdquo; were razed to the ground.</p>
<p>The result was to make bad worse.&nbsp; The wretched occupants
of the doomed houses clung to them with as much tenacity as
though each abode were an ark, and if they were turned out of it,
it would be to drown in the surrounding flood.&nbsp; When the
demolishers came with their picks and crows&mdash;the honest
housebreakers,&mdash;and mounted to the roof, the garret lodgers
retreated to the next floor, and so on, debating the ground step
by step before the inexorable pickaxe, until they were driven
into the cellar and could go no lower.&nbsp; Then they had to run
for it; but, poor purblind wretches, they had lived so long in
dungeon darkness, that the broad light of day was
unbearable.&nbsp; Like rats disturbed from a drain, all they
desired was to escape out of sight and hide again; and again,
like rats, they knew of neighbouring burrows and scuttled to them
with all speed.</p>
<p>Ousted from Slusher&rsquo;s Alley, they sought Grimes&rsquo;s
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Rents.&nbsp; Grimes&rsquo;s Rents were already fully
occupied by renters, but the present was a calamity that might
overtake anyone, and the desired shelter was not refused.&nbsp;
It was a mere matter of packing a little closer.&nbsp; The donkey
that lodged in the cellar was turned into the wash-house, and
there was a commodious apartment for a large family, and nothing
was easier than to rig up an old counterpane on an extended
string, so converting one chamber into two.&nbsp; Hard as it is
to believe, and in mockery of all our Acts of Parliament for the
better ordering of lodging-houses, and our legal enactments
regulating the number of cubic feet of air every lodger was
entitled to and might insist on, in hundreds of cases this
condition of things exists at the present writing.&nbsp; Within a
stone&rsquo;s cast of the Houses of Parliament, where sit six
hundred wise gentlemen empanelled to make what laws they please
for improving the condition of the people, every one of the said
six hundred being an educated man of liberal mind, and fully
recognising the Christian maxim that godliness and cleanliness
are identical, may be found human creatures housed in places that
would ruin the health of a country-bred pig were he removed
thereto.&nbsp; In these same places parents and grown up and
little children herd in the same room night and day.&nbsp;
Sickness does not break up the party, or even the presence of
grim Death himself.&nbsp; Singularly enough, however, more
ceremony is observed with new life than with old Death.&nbsp; A
missionary friend related to me the case of a family of five
inhabiting one small room, and the youngest boy, aged thirteen,
died.&nbsp; The domestic arrangements, however, were not in the
least <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>disturbed by the melancholy event; the lad&rsquo;s
coffin was laid against the wall, and meals were cooked and eaten
and the two beds made and occupied as usual until the day of
burial.&nbsp; A little while after, however, the mother gave
birth to a child, and my friend visiting the family found it
grouped on the landing partaking of a rough-and-ready tea.&nbsp;
It was voted &ldquo;undacent to be inthrudin&rsquo;&rdquo; until
next day.&nbsp; However, the decent scruples of the head of the
family did not hold out beyond that time, and by the evening of
the next day the old order of things was quite restored.</p>
<p>How in the name of goodness and humanity can we, under such
circumstances, hope to be delivered from the curse of neglected
children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> happily ignorant reader, whose
knowledge of the criminal classes is confined to an occasional
glance through the police court and Sessions cases as narrated in
his morning newspaper, will be shocked and amazed to learn that
within the limits of the City of London alone, an army of male
and female thieves, twenty thousand strong, find daily and
nightly employment.</p>
<p>It is easy to write &ldquo;twenty thousand,&rdquo; and easier
still to read the words.&nbsp; Easier than all to pass them by
with but a vague idea of their meaning, and perhaps a sympathetic
shrug of the shoulders for the poor, hard-worked <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>policemen who
must have such a terrible time of it in keeping such an enormous
predatory crew in anything like order.&nbsp; Still, and without
the least desire to be &ldquo;sensational,&rdquo; I would ask the
reader, does he fully comprehend what twenty thousand thieves in
London means?&nbsp; Roughly estimating the population of the
metropolis as numbering three millions, it means that amongst us
one person in every hundred and fifty is a forger, a
housebreaker, a pickpocket, a shoplifter, a receiver of stolen
goods or what not; a human bird of prey, in short, bound to a
desperate pursuit of that terrible course of life into which vice
or misfortune originally casts him; a wily, cunning man-wolf,
constantly on the watch, seeking whom he may devour.</p>
<p>Almost every member of this formidable host is known to the
&ldquo;police,&rdquo; but unfortunately this advantage is almost
counterbalanced by the fact that the police are as well known to
the majority of the twenty thousand.&nbsp; To their experienced
eyes, it is not the helmet and the blue coat that makes the
policeman.&nbsp; Indeed, they appear to depend not so much on
visual evidence as on some subtle power of scent such as the fox
possesses in discovering the approach of their natural
enemy.&nbsp; They can discover the detective in his
innocent-looking smock-frock or bricklayer jacket, while he is
yet distant the length of a street.&nbsp; They know him by his
step, or by his clumsy affectation of unofficial
loutishness.&nbsp; They recognise the stiff neck in the loose
neckerchief.&nbsp; They smell &ldquo;trap,&rdquo; and are
superior to it.</p>
<p>There is a language current amongst them that is to <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>be met with
in no dictionary with which I am acquainted.&nbsp; I doubt if
even the &ldquo;slang dictionary&rdquo; contains more than a few
of the following instances that may be accepted as genuine.&nbsp;
It will be seen that the prime essential of &ldquo;thieves&rsquo;
latin&rdquo; is brevity.&nbsp; By its use, much may in one or two
words be conveyed to a comrade while rapidly passing him in the
street, or, should opportunity serve, during a visit to him while
in prison.</p>

<p>A boy thief, lithe and thin and daring, such a one as
housebreakers hire for the purpose of entering a small window at
the rear of a dwelling house&mdash;<i>a little snakesman</i>.</p>
<p>So pertinaciously do the inhabitants of criminal colonies
stick to their &ldquo;latin,&rdquo; that a well-known writer
suggests that special religious tracts, suiting their condition,
should be printed in the language, as an almost certain method of
securing their attention.</p>
<p>There can be no question that that of the professional thief
is a bitterly severe and laborious occupation, beset with
privations that moral people have no conception of, and involves
an amount of mental anxiety and torment that few human beings can
withstand through a long lifetime.&nbsp; Some years ago a
clergyman with a thorough acquaintance with the subject he was
handling, wrote on &ldquo;Thieves and Thieving,&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Cornhill Magazine,&rdquo; and <i>apropos</i> of this
benumbing atmosphere of dread, that constantly encompasses even
the old &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But if an acquaintance with the
thieves&rsquo; quarters revealed to me the amazing subtlety and
cleverness of the pilfering fraternity, it also taught me the
guilty fear, the wretchedness, the moral guilt, and the fearful
hardships <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>that fall to the lot of the professional thief.&nbsp;
They are never safe for a moment, and this unceasing jeopardy
produces a constant nervousness and fear.&nbsp; Sometimes when
visiting the sick, I have gently laid my hand on the shoulder of
one of them, who happened to be standing in the street.&nbsp; The
man would &lsquo;start like a guilty thing upon a fearful
summons,&rsquo; and it would take him two or three minutes to
recover his self-possession sufficiently to ask me &lsquo;How are
you to-day, sir?&rsquo;&nbsp; I never saw the adage,
&lsquo;Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind,&rsquo; so
painfully illustrated as in the thieves&rsquo; quarter, by the
faces of grey-haired criminals, whose hearts had been worn into
hardness by the dishonouring chains of transportation.&nbsp;
When, in the dusk of the evening, I have spoken to one of them as
he stood idly on the public-house steps, I have spoken in a low
and altered tone, so that he might not at first recognise me:
again the guilty start as the man bent forward, anxiously peering
into my face.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is never at rest, the wretched professional thief.&nbsp; He
goes about with the tools of war perpetually in his hands, and
with enemies in the front and the rear, and to the right and the
left of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anybody, to hear &rsquo;em talk,&rdquo;
a thief once remarked to me (he was a thief at present in
possession of liberty; not an incarcerated rogue plying
&ldquo;gammon&rdquo; as the incarcerated rogue loves to ply it),
&ldquo;anybody would think, to hear &rsquo;em talk, that it was
all sugar with us while we were free, and that our sufferings did
not begin until we were caught, and &lsquo;put away.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Them that think so know nothing about it.&nbsp; Take a case, now,
of a man who is in for getting his living <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>&lsquo;on the
cross,&rsquo; and who has got a &lsquo;kid&rsquo; or two, and
their mother, at home.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say that it is
<i>my</i> case, but you can take it so if you like.&nbsp;
<i>She</i> isn&rsquo;t a thief.&nbsp; Ask her what she knows
about me, and she&rsquo;ll tell you that, wuss luck, I&rsquo;ve
got in co. with some bad uns, and she wishes that I
hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She wishes that I hadn&rsquo;t,
p&rsquo;raps&mdash;not out of any sort of Goody-two-shoes
feeling, but because she loves me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the name of
it; <i>we</i> haint got any other word for the feelin&rsquo;; and
she can&rsquo;t bear to think that I may, any hour, be dragged
off for six mouths, or a year, p&rsquo;raps.&nbsp; And
them&rsquo;s my feelings, too, and no mistake, day after day, and
Sundays as well as week-days.&nbsp; She isn&rsquo;t fonder of me
than I am of her, I&rsquo;ll go bail for that; and as for the
kids, the girl especially, why I&rsquo;d skid a waggon wheel with
my body rather than her precious skin should be grazed.&nbsp;
Well, take my word for it, I never go out in the morning, and the
young &rsquo;un sez &lsquo;good bye,&rsquo; but what I think
&lsquo;good bye&mdash;yes! p&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;s good bye for a
longer spell than you&rsquo;re dreaming about, you poor little
shaver.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when I get out into the street, how long
am I safe?&nbsp; Why, only for the straight length of that
street, as far as I can see the coast clear.&nbsp; I may find a
stopper at any turning, or at any corner.&nbsp; And when you
<i>do</i> feel the hand on your collar!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve often
wondered what must be a chap&rsquo;s feelings when the white cap
is pulled over his peepers, and old Calcraft is pawing about his
throat, to get the rope right.&nbsp; It must be a sight worse
than the <i>other</i> feeling, you&rsquo;ll say.&nbsp; Well, if
it is, I wonder how long the chap manages to hold up till
he&rsquo;s let go!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>I am
the more anxious to remark on these lingering relics of humanity,
and, I may almost say virtue, that, if properly sought, may be
discovered in the most hardened criminals, because, of late,
there appears to be a growing inclination to treat the habitual
criminal as though he had ceased to be human, and had degenerated
into the condition of the meanest and most irreclaimable of
predatory animals, fit only to be turned over to the tender
mercies of a great body of huntsmen who wear blue coats instead
of scarlet, and carry staves and handcuffs in place of whips and
horns, and to be pursued to death.&nbsp; I have already taken
occasion in the public newspapers, and I have much pleasure in
returning to the charge here, to exclaim against the barbarous
suggestions of a gentleman holding high position in the police
force, Colonel Fraser, Commissioner of the City Police.</p>
<p>Alluding to the Habitual Criminals Bill, Colonel Fraser
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill are chiefly
designed to ensure a clearer police supervision than now exists
over convicts at large on licence, and to extend it to persons
who have been, or may be convicted of felony; but all the pains
and penalties to which such persons are liable are made to depend
absolutely on proof being forthcoming that the alleged offenders
are actual licence holders, or convicted felons, and the great
difficulty which so frequently occurs in obtaining this proof
will present serious obstacles to a satisfactory working of the
statute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Organized as the English police forces are, it will be
most difficult for them, notwithstanding the contemplated <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>system of
registration, to account satisfactorily for the movements of
licence holders, or to obtain an effective supervision over them,
if they are determined to evade it.&nbsp; But the number of these
convicts at large is insignificant compared with the swarms of
repeatedly-convicted thieves, who give infinitely greater trouble
to the police than licence-holders, and who constantly escape
with a light sentence, from the impossibility of obtaining ready
proof of their former convictions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now comes the remedy for this unsatisfactory state of
affairs!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As a remedy for this, I would suggest that
every convict, on being liberated on licence, and every person
after a second conviction of felony, should be marked in prison,
on being set free, in such manner as the Secretary of State might
direct&mdash;as has been the practice in the case of deserters,
and men dismissed for misconduct from the army: such marking to
be accepted as sufficient proof of former convictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The precise mode in which this should be effected is
matter of detail; but, by a simple combination of alphabetical
letters, similar to that employed in distinguishing
postage-stamps, no two persons need bear precisely the same mark,
and the arrangement of letters might be such as to show at a
glance, not only the particular prison in which the offender had
been last confined, but also the date of his last
conviction.&nbsp; Copies of these marks, transmitted to the
Central Office of Registration in London, would form an
invaluable record of the history of habitual criminals, and
enable the police to obtain that <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>reliable information as to their
antecedents, the want of which now so commonly enables practised
offenders to escape the consequences of their misdeeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attempts might, and probably would, be made to alter
the appearance of the tell-tale imprints; but it would be
impossible to efface them, and any artificial discoloration of
the skin appearing on the particular part of the arm, or body,
fixed upon for the prison mark, should be considered as affording
sufficient proof of former convictions; unless the person charged
could show&mdash;to the satisfaction of the justice before whom
he might be brought&mdash;that it was produced by legitimate
means.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have ventured to transcribe, in its integrity, the main
portion of Colonel Fraser&rsquo;s &ldquo;new idea,&rdquo;
thinking that its importance demanded it.&nbsp; It is significant
of much that is to be regretted, coming from such a source.&nbsp;
It is somewhat excusable, maybe, in a common policeman&mdash;who
yesterday may have been an agricultural labourer, or a member of
a community of which no more in the way of education is
expected&mdash;if he exhibits a kind of unreasoning, watch-dog
antagonism towards the criminal classes.&nbsp; He is instructed
in all sorts of man&oelig;uvres, and paid a guinea a week to act
<i>against</i> them&mdash;to oppose the weight of his
officially-striped arm, and the full force of his handy staff
against them, whenever he finds plausible excuse for doing
so.&nbsp; And, possibly, this is a condition of affairs one
should not be over eager to reform.&nbsp; The policeman,
&ldquo;too clever by half,&rdquo; is generally an instrument of
injustice, and an impediment in the way of the <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>law&rsquo;s
impartial acting.&nbsp; So long as the common constable remains a
well-regulated machine, and fulfils his functions without jarring
or unnecessary noise, we will ask no more; but without doubt we
expect, and we have a right to expect, some display of
intelligence and humanity on the part of the chief engineer who
directs and controls these machines.&nbsp; An official of polite
education, and possessed of a thorough knowledge of the ways and
means and the various resources of the enemy it is his duty to
provide against, should be actuated by some more generous
sentiment than that which points towards uncompromising
extermination.&nbsp; Colonel Fraser should bear in mind that an
act of criminality does not altogether change a man&rsquo;s
nature.&nbsp; He is a human creature in which, perhaps through
accident, perhaps through desperate, and to some extent
deliberate culture, certain growths, injurious to the welfare of
the commonwealth, have growth; but to brand, and destroy, and
crush under the heel the said creature because of his
objectionable affections, is much like smashing a set of valuable
vases because stagnant water has been permitted to accumulate in
them.&nbsp; It may be urged that if the said vases or men have
secreted criminal vice and fouling until their whole substance
has become saturated beyond possibility of cleansing, then the
sooner they are utterly abolished the better.&nbsp; To this I
answer that until the best known methods of cleansing have been
tried on the foul vessels we are not in a position to say that
they are irreclaimable; and again, even provided that you might
discover certain such vessels fit for nothing but destruction, it
would be <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>a
monstrous absurdity to issue an edict ordering the annihilation
of every pot of a like pattern.&nbsp; And this is pretty much as
Colonel Fraser would act.</p>
<p>Let the reader for a moment consider what would be the effect
if such a law as that proposed by the Commissioner of Police for
the City of London were passed.&nbsp; In the first place it
would, in its immediate operation, prove immensely unjust to the
milder sort of criminal.&nbsp; If we started anew with our army
of twenty thousand to-morrow morning, and every member of it had
been convicted but once, there would be fairness (admitting just
for argument sake only that there is any fairness at all about
it) in holding out the threat that the next man who committed
himself should be branded.&nbsp; But, as the case stands, before
a month had elapsed we should have hundreds of unlucky wretches
against whose names but two felonious commitments stood, bearing
the hateful brand, while thousands of the old and wary of the
tribe acquainted with the interior of every prison in England
would, as far as the tell-tale mark is concerned, appear as
innocent as you or I.&nbsp; Nor would any &ldquo;alphabetical
postal system,&rdquo; however ingenious and cold-blooded, avoid
this difficulty.&nbsp; The only way of doing full justice to the
entire body of felons&mdash;the young beginners and the old
practitioners&mdash;would be, whenever the latter were next taken
to search all the prison records for convictions against them,
and score them in regular order on the delinquents&rsquo;
writhing flesh.&nbsp; To do this, however, Colonel Fraser would
have to abandon his idea of branding on the arm.&nbsp; That
member would in many cases afford <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>inadequate space, even if you brought
the chronicle from the shoulder to the finger tips, and
&ldquo;turned over&rdquo; and continued the length of the
criminal&rsquo;s palm.&nbsp; As the newspaper reports frequently
show, there are evil doers whose catalogues of crimes may
scarcely be expressed in a century.</p>
<p>But these are the bad ones already so branded and seared in
heart and mind that to prick and scorch an inch of their outward
skin would be but to tickle their vanity, and give them to brag
of another scar, got in their life-long war against
society.&nbsp; Short of torturing them or killing them, it
matters little what measures are provided against these
case-hardened villains.&nbsp; But there are scores and hundreds
who though they have earned for themselves the names of
criminals, whom to class and force to herd with the
before-mentioned set would be to incur the greatest
responsibility, and one that under existing circumstances it
would be utterly short of wanton brutality to engage in.</p>
<p>As regards the class last mentioned, that is to say, those
members who have at present made no very desperate acquaintance
with crime and its punishment, I believe that if they were but
judiciously dealt with a very large number would be but too glad
to escape from their present life of misery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many a
thief,&rdquo; says a writer, whose able remarks are the more
valuable, because they are founded on actual experience and
conversation with the people he treats of; &ldquo;many a thief is
kept in reluctant bondage to crime from the difficulties he finds
in obtaining honest employment, and earning <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>honest
bread.&nbsp; Many thieves are fond of their criminal
calling.&nbsp; They will tell you plainly that they do not intend
to work hard for a pound a week, when they can easily earn five
times as much by thieving in less time and live like
gentlemen.&nbsp; But others of them are utterly weary of the
hazard, disgrace, and suffering attaching to their mode of
life.&nbsp; Some of them were once pure, honest, and industrious,
and when they are sick, or in prison, they are frequently filled
with bitter remorse, and make the strongest vows to have done
with a guilty life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose a man of this sort in prison.&nbsp; His eyes
are opened, and he sees before him the gulf of remediless ruin
into which he will soon be plunged.&nbsp; He knows well enough
that the money earned by thieving goes as fast as it comes, and
that there is no prospect of his ever being able to retire on his
ill-gotten gains.&nbsp; He comes out of prison, determined to
reform.&nbsp; But where is he to go?&nbsp; What is he to
do?&nbsp; How is he to live?&nbsp; Whatever may have been done
for him in prison, is of little or no avail, if as soon as he
leaves the gaol he must go into the world branded with crime,
unprotected and unhelped.&nbsp; The discharged prisoner must be
friendly with some one, and he must live.&nbsp; His criminal
friends will entertain him on the understood condition that they
are repaid from the booty of his next depredation.&nbsp; Thus the
first food he eats, and the first friendly chat he has, becomes
the half necessitating initiative of future crime.&nbsp;
Frequently the newly discharged prisoner passes through a round
of riot and drunkenness immediately on his release from a long
incarceration, as any other man would do in similar <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>circumstances, and who has no fixed principles to
sustain him.&nbsp; And so by reason of the rebound of newly
acquired liberty, and the influence of the old set, the man is
again demoralized.&nbsp; The discharged prisoner leaves gaol with
good resolves, but the moment he enters the world, there rises
before him the dark and spectral danger of being hunted down by
the police, and being recognised and insulted, of being shunned
and despised by his fellow workmen, of being everywhere contemned
and forsaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that to this utter want of friends of
the right sort at the moment of leaving prison, may be attributed
a very large percentage of the persistence in a career of crime
by those who have once made a false step.&nbsp; In this respect
we treat our criminals of comparatively a mild character with
greater harshness and severity than those whose repeated offences
have led to their receiving the severest sentences of the
law.&nbsp; The convict who is discharged after serving a term of
five years at Portland, receives ere he quits the gates of
Millbank prison a money gratuity, varying in amount according to
the character that was returned with him from the convict
establishment.&nbsp; Nor do the chances that are afforded him of
quitting his old course of life and becoming an honest man end
here.&nbsp; There is the Prisoner&rsquo;s Aid Society, where he
may obtain a little more money and a suit of working clothes, and
if he really shows an inclination to reform, he may be even
recommended to a situation.&nbsp; Put for the poor wretch who has
given society much less offence, who has become a petty thief,
probably not from choice, but from hard necessity, and who
bitterly <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>repents of his offences, there is no one to take him by
the hand and give or lend him so much as an honest half-crown to
make a fair start with.&nbsp; It may be said that the convict is
most in want of help because he <i>is</i> a convict, because he
is a man with whom robberies and violence have become so
familiar, that it is needful to provide him with some substantial
encouragement lest he slide back into the old groove.&nbsp;
Further, because he is a man so plainly branded that the most
inexperienced policeman may know at a glance what he is; whereas,
the man who has been but once convicted may, if he have the
inclination, push his way amongst honest men, and not one of them
be the wiser as to the slip he has made.&nbsp; And that would be
all very well if he were assisted in rejoining the ranks of
honest bread-winners, but what is his plight when the prison door
shuts behind him?&nbsp; It was his poverty that urged him to
commit the theft that consigned him to gaol, and now he is turned
out of it poorer than ever, crushed and spirit-broken, and with
all his manliness withered within him.&nbsp; He feels ashamed and
disgraced, and for the first few hours of his liberty he would
willingly shrink back for hiding, even to his prison, because, as
he thinks, people look at him so.&nbsp; A little timely help
would save him, but nothing is so likely as desperate
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; to spring out of this
consciousness of guilt, and the suspicion of being shunned and
avoided; and the army of twenty thousand gains another
recruit.</p>
<p>This undoubtedly is frequently the case with the criminal
guilty of but a &ldquo;first offence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Be he man or
lad, however, he will be subject to no such painful embarrassment
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>on his
leaving prison after a second or third conviction.&nbsp; By that
time he will have made friends.&nbsp; He will have found a
companion or two to &ldquo;work with,&rdquo; and they will keep
careful reckoning of the date of his incarceration as well as of
the duration of his term of durance.&nbsp; Make no doubt that
they will be on the spot to rejoice with him on his
release.&nbsp; They know the exact hour when the prison gate will
open and he will come forth, and there they are ready to shake
hands with him.&nbsp; Ready to &ldquo;stand treat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ready to provide him with that pipe of tobacco for which he has
experienced such frequent longing, and to set before him the
foaming pot of beer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come along, old pal!&rdquo; say
they, &ldquo;we thought that you&rsquo;d be glad of a drink and a
bit of bacca, and we&rsquo;ve got a jolly lot of beef over some
baked taters at home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What becomes of all his good resolutions&mdash;of the
chaplain&rsquo;s wholesome counsel now!&nbsp; &ldquo;Shut your
eyes resolutely to the temptations your old companions may hold
out to you,&rdquo; were the parting words of that good man;
&ldquo;if they threaten you, bid them defiance.&nbsp; Let it be
the first test of your good resolves to tell them plainly and
boldly that you have done with them and will have no more to do
with them!&rdquo;&nbsp; Most excellent advice truly! but how is
the emancipated one to act on it?&nbsp; How can he find it in his
heart to dash with cold ingratitude such warmth of generosity and
good nature?&nbsp; What claim has he on them that they should
treat him so?&nbsp; They owe him nothing, and can have no
ulterior and selfish object in thus expending their time <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>and their
money on his comfort.&nbsp; All that they expect in return is,
that should either of them fall into trouble similar to his, he
will exert himself for him in the same manner, and surely that is
little enough to ask.&nbsp; Perhaps with the chaplain&rsquo;s
good advice still ringing in his ears, a sigh of lingering
remorse is blended with the outpuffing of that first delicious
pipe, but it is promptly swallowed down in the draught of free
beer, with the grim reflection, perhaps, that if those professing
to be his friends came to his timely assistance as promptly and
substantially as did those his enemies, he might have been saved
the ignominy of entering anew on the old crimeful path.</p>
<p>As I have endeavoured to show, the best time for treating with
these unhardened criminals for their reform, is just before they
leave the prison at the expiration of their sentence, or so soon
as they have crossed its threshold and find themselves free
men.&nbsp; But even if they are here missed and allowed to go
their sinful way, it is not absolutely necessary to postpone the
good work until the law lays hold on them again.&nbsp; The dens
to which they retire are not impregnable.&nbsp; They do not live
in fortified caves, the doors of which are guarded by savage dogs
and by members of the gang armed with swords and pistols.&nbsp;
It is wonderful how docile and respectful they will behave
towards folk who visit them, treating them as nothing worse than
fellow creatures suffering under a great misfortune, and not as
savage creatures of prey who have forfeited all claim to human
nature, and are fit only to be scourged and branded.&nbsp; A
writer already quoted tells us that during <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>two years
in one of the largest towns in England he had unlimited access to
the thieves&rsquo; quarter at all hours and under any
circumstances&mdash;weddings, midnight gatherings, &ldquo;benefit
nights,&rdquo; public houses, he has visited them all.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How I gained the confidence of the criminal fraternity I
cannot say.&nbsp; I only sought their welfare, never went amongst
them without some good errand, never asked questions about their
affairs, or meddled with things that did not belong to me; and it
is due to the thieves themselves to say that I never received
from any of them, whether drunk or sober, an unkind look or a
disrespectful word. . . .&nbsp; I had not pursued my quiet
mission amongst the thieves many months without discovering the
damning fact that they had no faith in the sincerity, honesty, or
goodness of human nature; and that this last and vilest
scepticism of the human heart was one of the most powerful
influences at work in the continuation of crime.&nbsp; They
believe people in general to be no better than themselves, and
that most people will do a wrong thing if it serves their
purpose.&nbsp; They consider themselves better than many
&ldquo;square&rdquo; (honest) people who practise commercial
frauds.&nbsp; Not having a spark of faith in human nature their
ease is all but hopeless; and only those who have tried the
experiment can tell how difficult it is to make a thief believe
that you are really disinterested and mean him well.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the agencies that are at work for the arrest of
crime are all more or less working to good purpose, and conducing
to a good end.&nbsp; Had I previously known nothing of the zeal
and labour that have been expended during the last few years in
behalf of <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>the criminal population, I should have learned from my
intercourse with the thieves themselves, that a new spirit was
getting amongst them, and that something for their good was going
on outside thievedom.&nbsp; The thieves, the worst of them, speak
gloomily of the prospects of the fraternity; just as a Red Indian
would complain of the dwindling of his tribe before the strong
march of advancing civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In every essential particular can I corroborate the above
account.&nbsp; There are few worse places in London than certain
parts of Cow Cross, especially that part of it anciently known as
Jack Ketch&rsquo;s Warren, or &ldquo;Little Hell&rdquo; as the
inhabitants more commonly designate it, on account of the number
of subjects it produced for the operations of the common
hangman.&nbsp; Only that the law is more merciful than of yore,
there is little doubt that the vile nests in question, including
&ldquo;Bit Alley,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Broad Yard,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Frying Pan Alley,&rdquo; would still make good its claim
to the distinguishing title conferred on it.&nbsp; The place
indicated swarms with thieves of every degree, from the
seven-year old little robber who snatches petty articles from
stalls and shop-fronts, to the old and experienced burglar with a
wide experience of convict treatment, British and foreign.&nbsp;
Yet, accompanied by a city missionary well known to them, I have
many a time gone amongst them, feeling as safe as though I was
walking along Cheapside.&nbsp; I can give testimony even beyond
that of the writer last quoted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never asked
questions about their affairs, or meddled with things that <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>did not
concern me,&rdquo; says the gentleman in question.&nbsp; I can
answer for it that my pastor friend of the Cow Cross Mission was
less forbearing.&nbsp; With seasoned, middle-aged scoundrels he
seldom had any conversation, but he never lost a chance of
tackling young men and lads on the evil of their ways, and to a
purpose.&nbsp; Nor was it his soft speech or polished eloquence
that prevailed with them.&nbsp; He was by no means a gloomy
preacher against crime and its consequences; he had a cheerful
hopeful way with him that much better answered the purpose.&nbsp;
He went about his Christian work humming snatches of hymns in the
liveliest manner.&nbsp; One day while I was with him, we saw
skulking along before us a villanous figure, ragged and dirty,
and with a pair of shoulders broad enough to carry sacks of
coal.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; whispered my missionary friend,
&ldquo;is about the very worst character we have.&nbsp; He is as
strong as a tiger, and almost as ferocious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old
Bull&rdquo; they call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought it likely we would pass without recognising so
dangerous an animal, but my friend was not so minded.&nbsp; With
a hearty slap on his shoulder, the fearless missionary accosted
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Old Bull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! &rsquo;ow do, Mr. Catlin, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well as I should like to see you, my friend.&nbsp;
How are you getting along, Bull?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, werry dicky, Mr. Catlin.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Bull hung
his ears and pawed uncomfortably in a puddle, with one slipshod
foot, as though in his heart resenting being &ldquo;pinned&rdquo;
after this fashion.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;You find matters going worse and worse with you,
ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be no worser than they is,
that&rsquo;s <i>one</i> blessin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now there&rsquo;s where you are mistaken,
Bull.&nbsp; They can be worse a thousand times, and they
<i>will</i>, unless you turn over a fresh leaf.&nbsp; Why not,
Bull?&nbsp; See what a tattered, filthy old leaf the old one
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Bull, with an uneasy glance towards the outlet of the alley,
but still speaking with all respect,) &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s all
that, guv&rsquo;nor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, since you <i>must</i> begin on a fresh leaf,
why not try the right leaf&mdash;the honest one, eh, Bull.&nbsp;
Just to see how you like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mister Catlin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll think about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to the Lord you would, Bull.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
not much to laugh at, take my word for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, guv&rsquo;nor, I ain&rsquo;t a larfin.&nbsp;
I means to be a reg&rsquo;lar model some day&mdash;when I get
time.&nbsp; Morning, Mister Catlin, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And away went &ldquo;Old Bull,&rdquo; with a queer sort of
grin on his repulsive countenance, evidently no better or worse
for the brief encounter with his honest adviser, but very
thankful indeed to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been up into that man&rsquo;s room,&rdquo;
said my tough little, cheerful missionary, &ldquo;and rescued his
wife out of his great cruel hands, when three policemen stood on
the stairs afraid to advance another step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would do more than in his blunt, rough-and-ready way point
out to them what a shameful waste of <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>their lives it was to be skulking in
a filthy court all day without the courage to go out and seek
their wretched living till the darkness of night.&nbsp; He would
offer to find them a job; he made many friends, and was enabled
to do so, earnestly exhorting them to try honest work just for a
month, to find out what it was like, and the sweets of it.&nbsp;
And many have tried it; some as a joke&mdash;as a whimsical feat
worth engaging in for the privilege of afterwards being able to
brag of it, and returned to their old practice in a day or two;
others have tried it, and, to their credit be it spoken, stuck to
it.&nbsp; In my own mind I feel quite convinced that if such men
as Mr. C., of the Cow Cross Mission, who holds the keys not only
of the houses in which thieves dwell, but, to a large extent,
also, a key to the character and peculiarities of the thieves
themselves, were empowered with proper facilities, the amount of
good they are capable of performing would very much astonish
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span>, as most people are aware,
the great thief tribe reckons amongst its number an upper, and a
middle, and a lower class, pretty much as corresponding grades of
station are recognised amongst the honest community, it is
doubtful, in the former case, if promotion from one stage to
another may be gained by individual enterprise and talent and
industry.&nbsp; The literature of the country is from time to
time enriched by bragging autobiographies of villains confessed,
as well as by the penitent revelations of rogues reclaimed, but,
according to my observation, it does not appear that perseverance
in the humbler walks of crime lead invariably to the highway of
infamous prosperity.&nbsp; It seems to be an idea too
preposterous even to introduce into the pages of Newgate romance,
daring in their flights of fancy as are the authors affecting
that delectable line.&nbsp; We have no sinister antithesis of the
well-known honest boy who tramped from Bristol to the metropolis
with twopence-halfpenny in his pocket, and <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>afterwards
became Lord Mayor of London.&nbsp; No low-browed ragged little
thief, who began his career by purloining a halfpenny turnip from
a costermonger&rsquo;s barrow, is immortalized in the page of the
Newgate Calendar, as finally arrived at the high distinction of
wearing fashionable clothes, and ranking as the first of
swell-mobsmen.&nbsp; It is a lamentable fact, and one that should
have weight with aspirants for the convict&rsquo;s mask and
badge, that the poor, shabby, hard-working thief so remains, till
the end of his days.&nbsp; There is no more chance of his
carrying his shameful figure and miserable hang-dog visage into
tip-top society of his order, than there is of his attaining the
summit of that treadwheel, with the ever-recurring steps of which
he is so painfully familiar.</p>
<p>And if there is a forlorn, abject, harassed wretch in the
world it is the poor, threadbare, timid London thief.&nbsp; I
believe the popular supposition to be that, to turn thief at
least ensures for the desperate adventurer money to squander for
the time being; that however severe may be the penalty paid for
the luxury, while &ldquo;luck&rdquo; lasts the picker of pockets
and purloiner of his neighbour&rsquo;s goods has ever at his
command means wherewith to satisfy the cravings of his vices,
however extravagant they may be&mdash;money to live on the fat of
the land and get drunk and enjoy happy spells of ease and
plenty.&nbsp; This, no doubt, is the tempting picture the devil
holds up for the contemplation of heart-sick honesty, when
patient integrity is growing faint with hunger and long
privation; and truly it seems not an improbable picture.&nbsp; <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>What
inducement is there for a man to persist in a career of
dishonesty with its certain and frequent penalties of prison and
hard labour, unless his perilous avocation ensures him spells,
albeit brief ones, of intoxicating enjoyment?</p>
<p>No wonder that the ignorant, sorely-tempted, out-o&rsquo;-work
labourer should take this view of the case, when men, who by
station and education&mdash;men who profess to have gone out of
their highly respectable paths in life to make such inquiries as
should qualify them to discuss the matter in solemn Parliamentary
conclave, declare that it is so.&nbsp; A curious exhibition of
the lamentable credulity of our law makers occurred no longer ago
than at the second reading of the Habitual Criminals Bill in the
House of Lords.&nbsp; Naturally the subject was one concerning
which their Lordships could know nothing, except by hearsay, and
Earl Shaftesbury volunteered to put them in possession of such
useful information as might guide them towards a decision as
regarded the projected Bill.</p>
<p>It is only fair to state, however, that his Lordship was not
personally responsible for his startling statements.&nbsp; He had
them from a &ldquo;practitioner,&rdquo; from a thief, that is to
say.&nbsp; His Lordship did not reveal whether it was a thief at
large who was his informant: but that is scarcely likely.&nbsp;
Doubtless it was from some weeping villain, with an eye to a
remission of his sentence, who so frankly confided to the
soft-hearted Earl the various secrets of that terrible trade it
was his intention never, <i>never</i> to work at again!&nbsp; At
any rate, whoever the &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; was, he
succeeded in his design completely, as the horror-stricken visage
of his lordship, <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>as he delivered himself of the astounding revelations,
fully attested.</p>
<p>They were to this effect, and the reader will please bear in
mind that they were not tendered to be received at their worth,
but as facts which might he relied on.&nbsp; Within the City of
London, Lord Shaftesbury declared, &ldquo;crucibles and
melting-pots are kept going all day and all night.&nbsp; I
believe that in a very large number of cases the whole of the
plate is reduced within two or three hours of the robbery to
ingots of silver.&nbsp; As for spoons, forks, and jewellery, they
are not taken so readily to the melting-pot; but to well-known
places where there is a pipe, similar to that which your
lordships may have seen&mdash;I hope none may have seen it of
necessity&mdash;in the shop of the pawnbroker.&nbsp; The thief
taps, the pipe is lifted up, and in the course of a minute a hand
comes out covered with a glove, takes up the jewellery, and gives
out the money for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If that conscienceless &ldquo;practitioner,&rdquo; who so
scandalously gulled the good Earl, happened to be in enjoyment of
liberty when the above quoted newspaper report was printed, how
he must have grinned as he perused it?&nbsp; But what an
unpleasant reversal of the joke it would be if the mendacious
statements of the bare-faced villain lead to the passing of a
bill imposing cruelly severe rules for the government of
criminals, and the worthy in question should one fine day find
himself groaning under the same!&nbsp; The most astounding part
of the business however, is, that his lordship should have given
credit to such a tissue of fudge.&nbsp; To his honour be it
stated, he <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>should know better.&nbsp; As an indefatigable labourer
amongst the poor and afflicted, his name will be remembered and
blest long after he has passed from among us.&nbsp; It is
doubtful if any other man whose title gives him admission to the
House of Lords, could have given nearly as much practical
information on this painful subject, and there can be no
question&mdash;and this is the most unfortunate part of the
business&mdash;that all that his lordship stated was regarded as
real.&nbsp; Every lord present to listen to and discuss the
various clauses of Lord Kimberley&rsquo;s Bill, probably took to
his vivid imagination the appalling picture of the underground
cellars (to be reached only by known members of the burglarious
brotherhood who could give the sign to the guardian of the
cellar-door), where certain demon-men of the Fagin type presided
constantly over crucibles and melting-pots, wherein bubbled and
hissed the precious brew of gold and silver ornaments dissolved,
the supply being constantly renewed by the bold
&ldquo;cracksmen&rdquo; who numerously attended to bring the
goods to market.&nbsp; Easier still even was it to conjure before
the mind&rsquo;s eye the peculiar operations of the
&ldquo;pipe&rdquo; that Lord Shaftesbury so graphically
described.&nbsp; The deserted-looking house in the gloomy back
street, with the street door always ajar so that customers might
slip in and out at it in an instant&mdash;before even the
policeman on beat could wink his sleepy eyes in amazement at the
unexpected apparition; with the sliding panel in the
dimly-lighted back kitchen, and the &ldquo;spout&rdquo; just like
a pawnbroker&rsquo;s, and the &ldquo;gloved hand,&rdquo; the
fingers of it twitching with eager greed for the gold watch,
still warm <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>from the pocket of its rightful owner!&nbsp; How was it
possible to deal with a subject bristling so with horrors with
calmness and dignity?&nbsp; Their lordships had been given to
understand by the mover of the bill that there were fifteen
thousand thieves constantly busy in the Metropolis alone, and
Lord Shaftesbury had informed them that the mysterious
&ldquo;spout&rdquo; and the melting-pot were the chief channels
for converting stolen goods into ready money.&nbsp; At this rate,
London must be almost undermined by these gold-melting
cellars&mdash;the midnight traveller through the great city might
plainly hear and wonder at the strange tap-tapping that met his
ears&mdash;the tapping at the &ldquo;spout&rdquo; that notified
to the owner of the gloved hand that a new customer was in
attendance?&nbsp; It would have been not very surprising if the
Chief Commissioner of Police had been instantly communicated
with, and given instructions at once to arrest every man and
woman of the fifteen thousand, and hold them in safe keeping
until their lordships had resolved on the most efficacious, and
at the same time least painful way of exterminating them.</p>
<p>Seriously, it is impossible almost to exaggerate the amount of
mischief likely to result from such false and inflammatory
pictures of an evil that in its naked self is repulsive enough in
all conscience.&nbsp; On the one hand, it excites amongst the
people panic and unnecessary alarm, and furnishes the undeniable
excuse of &ldquo;self-defence&rdquo; for any excess of severity
we may be led into; and on the other hand, it tends to magnify
the thief&rsquo;s importance in the eyes of the thief, and to
invest his melancholy and everlastingly miserable avocations with
precisely the same <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>kind of gallows-glory as is preached by the authors of
&ldquo;Tyburn Dick&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Boy
Highwayman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Curiously enough at the conclusion of
his long and interesting speech, Lord Shaftesbury went a little
out of his way to make mention of the literature of the kind just
quoted, to remark on its intimate bearing on the crime of the
country, and to intimate that shortly the whole question would be
brought under their lordships&rsquo; consideration.&nbsp; It is
doubtful, however, and I say so with extreme regret, knowing as I
well do how shocking even the suspicion of such a thing must be
to Lord Shaftesbury, if in any dozen &ldquo;penny numbers&rdquo;
of the pernicious trash in question, the young aspirant for
prison fame would find as much stimulative matter as was provided
in his lordship&rsquo;s speech, or rather speeches, on the
Habitual Criminal question.</p>
<p>No, the affairs of those who affect the criminal walks of life
are bad enough in all conscience, but they are much less romantic
than his lordship has been led to believe.&nbsp; Shorn of the
melo-dramatic &ldquo;bandit&rdquo; costume with which they have
been temporarily invested they lose nothing in appalling
effect.</p>
<p>Truly, it is hard to understand, but it is an undoubted fact,
that the criminal who in police nomenclature is a &ldquo;low
thief&rdquo; (to distinguish him, it may be presumed, from
&ldquo;the respectable thief&rdquo;) is without exception of all
men the most comfortless and miserable; and should the reader be
so inquisitive as to desire to be informed of the grounds on
which I arrive at this conclusion, I beg to assure him that I do
not rely on hearsay, neither do I <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>depend on what thieves incarcerated
for their offences have told me, holding it to be hardly likely
that a prisoner in prison would vaunt his liking for crime and
his eagerness to get back to it.&nbsp; I have mixed with thieves
at liberty, an unsuspected spy in their camp, more than
once.&nbsp; I will quote an example.</p>
<p>This was many years since, and as at the time I published a
detailed account of the visit, I may be excused from more than
briefly alluding to it here.&nbsp; It was at a thieves&rsquo;
raffle, held at a public-house in one of the lowest and worst
parts of Westminster.&nbsp; I was young in the field of
exploration then, and from all that I had heard and read made up
my mind for something very terrible and desperate.&nbsp; I
pictured to myself a band of rollicking desperadoes, swaggering
and insolent, with plenty of money to pay for bottles of brandy
and egg-flip unlimited, and plenty of bragging discourse of the
doughty deeds of the past, and of their cold-blooded and
desperate intentions for the future.&nbsp; Likewise, my
expectations of hope and fear included a rich treat in the shape
of vocalization.&nbsp; It was one thing to hear play-actors on
the stage, in their tame and feeble delineations of the ancient
game of &ldquo;high Toby,&rdquo; and of the redoubtable doings of
the Knights of the Road, spout such soul-thrilling effusions as
&ldquo;Nix my Dolly Pals,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Claude Duval,&rdquo;
but what must it be to listen to the same bold staves out of the
mouths of real &ldquo;roaring boys,&rdquo; some of them,
possibly, the descendants of the very heroes who rode &ldquo;up
Holborn Hill in a cart,&rdquo; and who could not well hear the
good words the attendant chaplain was uttering because <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>of the
noisy exchange of boisterous &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; taking place
between the short-pipe smoking driver, whose cart-seat was the
doomed man&rsquo;s coffin, and the gleeful mob that had made
holiday to see the fun!</p>
<p>But in all this I was dismally disappointed.&nbsp; I had
procured a ticket for the raffle from a friendly police-inspector
(goodness only knows how he came possessed of them, but he had
quite a collection of similar tickets in his pocket-book), and,
disguised for the occasion, I entered the dirty little dram shop,
and exhibited my credential to the landlord at the bar.&nbsp; So
far the business was promising.&nbsp; The said landlord was as
ill-looking a villain as could be desired.&nbsp; He had a broken
nose and a wooden leg, both of which deformities were doubtless
symptomatic of the furious brawls in which he occasionally
engaged with his ugly customers.&nbsp; As I entered he was
engaged in low-whispered discourse with three ruffians who might
have been brothers of his in a similar way of business, but
bankrupt, and gone to the dogs.&nbsp; As I advanced to the bar
the four cropped heads laid together in iniquity, separated
suddenly, and the landlord affected a look of innocence, and
hummed a harmless tune in a way that was quite melodramatic.</p>
<p>I intimated my business, and he replied shortly, &ldquo;Go on
through,&rdquo; at the same time indicating the back door by a
jerk of his thumb over his shoulder.&nbsp; Now for it!&nbsp; On
the other side of the back door I discovered a stone yard, at the
extremity of which was dimly visible in the darkness a long, low,
dilapidated building, with a light shining through the
chinks.&nbsp; This, then, was the robber&rsquo;s <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>den!&mdash;a place to which desperate men and women who
made robbery and outrage the nightly business of their lives,
resorted to squander in riot and debauchery their ill-gotten
gains!&nbsp; It would not have surprised me had I found the
doorkeeper armed with a pair of &ldquo;trusty barkers,&rdquo; and
every male guest of the company with a life-preserver sticking
out at the breast pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>The door was opened in response to my tap at it.&nbsp; I gave
the potman there stationed my ticket, and I entered.&nbsp; I must
confess that my first sensation as I cast my eye carelessly
around, was one of disgust that I should have been induced to
screw up my courage with so much pains for so small an
occasion.&nbsp; The building I found myself in was a
skittle-ground, furnished with forms and tables; and there were
present about thirty persons.&nbsp; As well as I can remember, of
this number a third were women, young generally, one or two being
mere girls of sixteen, or so.&nbsp; But Jenny Diver was not
there, nor Poll Maggot, nor Edgeworth Bess.&nbsp; No lady with
ringlets curling over her alabaster shoulders found a seat on the
knee of the gallant spark of her choice.&nbsp; No Captain
Macheath was to be seen elegantly taking snuff out of a stolen
diamond snuff-box, or flinging into the pink satin lap of his
lady love a handful of guineas to pay for more brandy.&nbsp; Poor
wretches! the female shoulders there assembled spoke rather of
bone than alabaster, while the washed-out and mended cotton
frocks served in place of pink satin, and hair of most humble
fashion surmounted faces by no means expressive either of genuine
jollity, or <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>even of a desperate determination towards
devil-may-careness, and the drowning of care in the bowl.&nbsp;
There were no bowls, even, as in the good old time, only vulgar
pewter porter pots, out of which the company thankfully swigged
its fourpenny.&nbsp; There was no appearance of hilarity, or
joviality even; no more of brag and flourish, or of affectation
of ease and freedom, than though every man and woman present were
here locked up &ldquo;on remand,&rdquo; and any moment might be
called out to face that damning piece of kept-back evidence they
all along dreaded was in store for them.&nbsp; To be sure it was
as yet early in the evening, and though the company may have
assembled mainly for the purpose of drowning &ldquo;dull
care,&rdquo; that malicious imp being but recently immersed, may
have been superior at present to their machinations, and able to
keep his ugly head above the liquid poured out for his
destruction.&nbsp; Or may be, again, being a very powerful
&ldquo;dull care,&rdquo; of sturdy and mature growth, he might be
able to hold out through many hours against the weak and watery
elements brought to oppose him.</p>
<p>Anyhow, so far as I was able to observe, there was no
foreshadowing of the blue and brooding imp&rsquo;s defeat.&nbsp;
His baneful wings seemed spread from one end of the skittle-alley
to the other, and to embrace even the chairman, who being a Jew,
and merely a receiver of stolen goods, might reasonably have been
supposed to be less susceptible than the rest.&nbsp; There would
seem to prevail, amongst a large and innocent section of the
community, a belief that the thief is a creature distinguished no
less by appearance than by character from the honest host <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>he thrives
by.&nbsp; I have heard it remarked more than once, by persons
whose curiosity has led them to a criminal court when a trial of
more than ordinary interest is proceeding, that really this
prisoner or that did not <i>look</i> like a thief, or a forger,
or stabber, as the case might be.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord bless
us,&rdquo; I once heard an elderly lady exclaim, in the case of
an oft-convicted scoundrel of the &ldquo;swell mob&rdquo; tribe,
over whose affecting trial she had shed many tears, &ldquo;Lord
bless us!&rdquo; said she, as the jury found him guilty, and
sentenced him to two years&rsquo; hard labour, &ldquo;so thin,
and genteel, and with spectacles on, too!&nbsp; I declare I
should have passed that young man twenty times without dreaming
of calling out for the police.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand,
there are very many persons less ingenuous than the old lady, who
invariably regard a man through the atmosphere of crime, real or
supposed, that envelopes him, and by means of its distorting
influence make out such a villain as satisfies their
sagacity.&nbsp; Had one of this last order been favoured with a
private view of the company assembled to assist at Mr.
Mullins&rsquo;s raffle, and have been previously informed that
they were one and all thieves, in all probability they would have
<i>appeared</i> thieves; but I am convinced that had they been
shown to an unprepared and unprejudiced observer, his opinion
would have been that the company gathered in the skittle-alley of
the &ldquo;Curly Badger&rdquo; were no worse than a poor set of
out-o&rsquo;-work tailors, or French polishers, or weavers, or of
some other craft, the members of which affect the gentility that
black clothes and a tall hat is supposed to confer on the <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>wearer; nor
would an hour in their society, such as I spent, have sufficed to
dissipate the innocent impression.&nbsp; Their expenditure was of
the most modest sort, not one man in six venturing beyond the pot
of beer.&nbsp; Their conversation, though not the most elegant,
was least of all concerning the wretched trade they followed;
indeed, the subject was never mentioned at all, except in
melancholy allusion to Peter or Jerry, who had been recently
&ldquo;copped&rdquo; (taken), and was expected to pass &ldquo;a
tail piece in the steel&rdquo; (three months in prison).&nbsp;
There was one observation solemnly addressed by one elderly man
to another elderly man, the purport of which at the time puzzled
me not a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unlucky!&nbsp; Well you may say
it.&nbsp; Black Maria is the only one that&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; a
trade now.&nbsp; Every journey full as a tuppenny
omblibus!&rdquo;&nbsp; I listened intently as prudence would
permit for further reference to the mysterious female who was
doing &ldquo;all the trade,&rdquo; and &ldquo;every
journey&rdquo; was &ldquo;as full as a twopenny omnibus,&rdquo;
but nothing in the conversation transpired tending to throw a
light on the dark lady; so I mentally made a note of it for
reference to my friend the inspector.&nbsp; He laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, she has been doing a brisk stroke of business of
late, I must say,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Black Maria, sir,
is our van of that colour that carries &rsquo;em off to serve
their time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as before observed, there was nothing in the demeanour of
either the men or women present at Mullins&rsquo;s raffle to
denote either that they revelled in the nefarious trade they
followed, or that they derived even ordinary comfort and
satisfaction from it.&nbsp; To be sure, it <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>may have
happened that the specimens of the thief class assembled before
me were not of the briskest, but taking them as they were, and
bearing in mind the spiritless, hang-dog, mean, and shabby set
they were, the notion of bringing to bear on them such tremendous
engines of repression as that suggested by the humane
Commissioner of the City Police appears nothing short of
ridiculous.</p>
<p>At the same time, I would have it plainly understood that my
pity for the thief of this class by no means induces me to advise
that no more effective means than those which at present exist
should be adopted for his abolition.&nbsp; A people&rsquo;s
respect for the laws of the country is its chief pillar of
strength, and those who have no respect for the laws, act as so
many rats undermining the said pillar, and although the rats
assembled at Mullins&rsquo;s raffle were not of a very formidable
breed, their hatred of the law, and their malicious defiance of
it, was unmistakeable.&nbsp; For instance, the article to be
raffled was a silk pocket handkerchief, and there it was duly
displayed hanging across a beam at the end of the
skittle-ground.&nbsp; The occasion of the raffle was, that Mr.
Mullins had just been released after four months&rsquo;
imprisonment, and that during his compulsory absence from home
matters had gone very bad, and none the less so because poor Mrs.
Mullins was suffering from consumption.&nbsp; In alluding to
these sad details of his misfortune, Mr. Mullins, in returning
thanks for the charity bestowed on him, looked the picture of
melancholy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whether she means ever to get on her
legs again is more than I can say,&rdquo; said he, wagging his <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>short-cropped head dolefully, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t
much chance, I reckon, when you&rsquo;re discharged from Brompton
incurable.&nbsp; Yes, my friends, it&rsquo;s all agin me lately,
and my luck&rsquo;s regler out.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s one thing
I must mention&rdquo; (and here he lifted his head with cheerful
satisfaction beaming in his eyes), &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure you
as doesn&rsquo;t know it will be very glad to hear it&mdash;the
handkerchief wot&rsquo;s put up to raffle here is the wery
identical one that I was put away for.&rdquo;&nbsp; And judging
from the hearty applause that followed this announcement, there
can be no doubt that Mr. Mullins&rsquo;s audience were very glad
indeed to hear it.</p>
<p>But even after this stimulant, the spirits of the company did
not rally anything to speak of.&nbsp; Song singing was started,
but nobody sung &ldquo;Nix my Dolly Pals,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Claude
Duval.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody raised a roaring chant in honour of
&ldquo;ruby wine,&rdquo; or the flowing bowl, or even of the more
humble, though no less genial, foaming can.&nbsp; There was a
comic song or two, but the ditties in favour were those that had
a deeply sentimental or even a funereal smack about them.&nbsp;
The gentleman who had enlightened me as to Black Maria sang the
Sexton, the chorus to which lively stave, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
provide you such a lodging as you never had before,&rdquo; was
taken up with much heartiness by all present.&nbsp; Mullins
himself, who possessed a fair alto voice, slightly damaged
perhaps by a four months&rsquo; sojourn in the bleak atmosphere
of Cold Bath Fields, sang &ldquo;My Pretty Jane,&rdquo; and a
very odd sight it was to observe that dogged, jail-stamped
countenance of his set, as accurately as Mullins could set it, to
<a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>an
expression matching the bewitching simplicity of the words of the
song.&nbsp; I was glad to observe that his endeavours were
appreciated and an encore demanded.</p>
<p>Decidedly the songs, taken as a whole, that the thieves sang
that evening in the Skittle Saloon of the &ldquo;Curly
Badger&rdquo; were much less objectionable than those that may be
heard any evening at any of our London music halls, and
everything was quiet and orderly.&nbsp; Of course I cannot say to
what extent this may have been due to certain rules and
regulations enforced by the determined looking gentleman who
served behind the bar.&nbsp; There was one thing, however, that
he could not enforce, and that was the kindliness that had
induced them to meet together that evening.&nbsp; I had before
heard, as everybody has, of &ldquo;honour amongst thieves,&rdquo;
but I must confess that I had never suspected that compassion and
charity were amongst the links that bound them together; and when
I heard the statement from the chair of the amount subscribed
(the &ldquo;raffle&rdquo; was a matter of form, and the silk
handkerchief a mere delicate concealment of the free gift of
shillings), when I heard the amount and looked round and reckoned
how much a head that might amount to, and further, when I made
observation of the pinched and poverty-stricken aspect of the
owners of the said heads, I am ashamed almost to confess that if
within the next few days I had caught an investigating hand in my
coat-tail pockets, I should scarcely have had the heart to
resist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is quite true that, counting
prostitutes and receivers of stolen goods, there are twenty
thousand individuals eating the daily bread of dishonesty within
the city of London alone; there are many more than these.&nbsp;
And the worst part of the business is, that those that are
omitted from the batch form the most painful and repulsive
feature of the complete picture.&nbsp; Shocking enough is it to
contemplate the white-haired, tottering criminal holding on to
the front of the dock because he dare not trust entirely his
quaking legs, and with no more to urge in his defence than Fagin
had when it came to the last&mdash;&ldquo;an old man, my lord, a
very old man;&rdquo; and we give him our pity ungrudgingly
because we are no longer troubled with fears for his hostility as
regards the present or the future.&nbsp; It is all over with him
or very nearly.&nbsp; The grave yawns for <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>him and we
cannot help feeling that after all he has hurt himself much more
than he has hurt us, and when we reflect on the awful account he
will presently be called on to answer, our animosity shrinks
aside, and we would recommend him to mercy if it were
possible.&nbsp; No, it is not those who have run the length of
their tether of crime that we have to fear, but those who by
reason of their tender age are as yet but feeble toddlers on the
road that leads to the hulks.&nbsp; It would be instructive as
well as of great service if reliable information could be
obtained as to the beginning of the down-hill journey by our
juvenile criminals.&nbsp; Without doubt it would be found that in
a lamentably large number of cases the beginning did not rest in
the present possessors at all, but that they were bred and
nurtured in it, inheriting it from their parents as certain forms
of physical disease are inherited.</p>
<p>In very few instances are they <i>trained</i> to thieving by a
father who possibly has gone through all the various phases of
criminal punishment, from the simple local oakum shed and
treadmill to the far-away stone quarry and mineral mine, and so
knows all about it.&nbsp; The said human wolf and enemy of all
law and social harmony, his progenitor, does not take his
firstborn on his knee as soon as he exhibits symptoms of knowing
right from wrong, and do his best to instil into his young mind
what as a candidate for Newgate honours the first principles of
his life should be.</p>
<p>This would be bad enough, but what really happens is
worse.&nbsp; To train one&rsquo;s own child to paths of rectitude
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>it is
necessary to make him aware of the existence of paths of iniquity
and wrong, that when inadvertently he approaches the latter, he
may recognise and shun them.&nbsp; So on the other hand, if by
the devil&rsquo;s agency a child is to be made bold and confident
in the wrong road, the right must be exhibited to him in a light
so ridiculous as to make it altogether distasteful to him.&nbsp;
Still a comparison is instituted, and matters may so come about
that one day he may be brought to re-consider the judiciousness
of his choice and perhaps to reverse his previous decision.&nbsp;
But if he has received no teaching at all; if in the benighted
den in which he is born, and in which his childish intellect
dawns, no ray of right and truth ever penetrates, and he grows
into the use of his limbs and as much brains as his brutish
breeding affords him, and with no other occupation before him
than to follow in the footsteps of his father the thief&mdash;how
much more hopeless is his case?</p>
<p>Does the reader ask, are there such cases?&nbsp; I can answer
him in sorrowful confidence, that in London alone they may be
reckoned in thousands.&nbsp; In parts of Spitalfields, in Flower
and Dean Street, and in Kent Street, and many other streets that
might be enumerated, they are the terror of small shopkeepers,
and in Cow Cross, with its horrible chinks in the wall that do
duty for the entrance of courts and alleys&mdash;Bit Alley,
Frying Pan Alley, Turk&rsquo;s Head-court, and Broad Yard, they
swarm like mites in rotten cheese.&nbsp; As a rule, the police
seldom make the acquaintance of this thievish small fry (if they
did, the estimated number of London robbers would be <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>considerably augmented); but occasionally, just as a
sprat will make its appearance along with a haul of mackerel, one
reads in the police reports of &ldquo;Timothy Mullins, a very
small boy, whose head scarcely reached the bar of the
dock;&rdquo; or of &ldquo;John Smith, a child of such tender age
that the worthy magistrate appeared greatly shocked,&rdquo;
charged with some one of the hundred acts of petty pilfering by
means of which the poor little wretches contrive to stave off the
pangs of hunger.&nbsp; Where is the use of reasoning with Master
Mullins on his evil propensities?&nbsp; The one propensity of his
existence is that of the dog&mdash;to provide against certain
gnawing pains in his belly.&nbsp; If he has another propensity,
it is to run away out of dread for consequences, which is
dog-like too.&nbsp; All the argument you can array against this
little human waif with one idea, will fail to convince him of his
guilt; he has his private and deeply-rooted opinion on the
matter, you may depend, and if he screws his fists into his eyes,
and does his earnest best to make them water&mdash;if when in the
magisterial presence he contorts his countenance in affected
agony, it is merely because he perceives from his worship&rsquo;s
tone that he wishes to agonize him, and is shrewd enough to know
that to &ldquo;give in best,&rdquo; as he would express it, is
the way to get let off easy.</p>
<p>But supposing that he were not overawed by the magisterial
presence, and felt free to speak what is foremost in his mind
unreservedly as he would speak it to one of his own set.&nbsp;
Then he would say, &ldquo;It is all very fine for you to sit
there, you that have not only had a jolly <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>good
breakfast, but can afford to sport a silver toothpick to pick
your teeth with afterwards, it is all very fine for you to preach
to me that I never shall do any good, but one of these days come
to something that&rsquo;s precious bad, if I don&rsquo;t cut the
ways of thieving, and take to honest ways.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s so
many different kinds of honest ways.&nbsp; <i>Yours</i> is a good
&rsquo;un.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t such a fool as not to know that
it&rsquo;s better to walk in honest ways like them
<i>you&rsquo;ve</i> got into, and to wear gold chains and velvet
waistcoats, than to prowl about in ragged corduroys, and dodge
the pleeseman, and be a prig: but how am I to get into them sorts
of honest ways?&nbsp; Will you give me a hist up to
&rsquo;em?&nbsp; Will you give me a leg-up&mdash;I&rsquo;m such a
little cove, you see&mdash;on to the bottom round of the ladder
that leads up to &rsquo;em?&nbsp; If it ain&rsquo;t in your line
to do so, p&rsquo;raps you could recommend me to a lady or
gentleman that would?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Then, however am <i>I</i>
to get into honest ways?&nbsp; Shall I make a start for &rsquo;em
soon as I leaves this ere p&rsquo;lice office, from which you are
so werry kind as to discharge me?&nbsp; Shall I let the chances
of stealing a turnip off a stall, or a loaf out of a
baker&rsquo;s barrow, go past me, while I keep straight on,
looking out for a honest way?&mdash;straight on, and straight on,
till I gets the hungry staggers (<i>you</i> never had the hungry
staggers, Mr. Magistrate), and tumble down on the road?&nbsp; I
am not such a fool, thank&rsquo;e.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see the
pull of it.&nbsp; I can do better in dishonest ways.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m much obliged to <span
class="GutSmall">YOU</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure of a crust,
though a hard &rsquo;un, while I stick to the latter, and if I
break down, you&rsquo;ll take care of me for a spell, and fatten
me up a bit; but s&rsquo;pose I <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>go on the hunt after them honest
ways you was just now preaching about, and I miss &rsquo;em, what
am I then?&nbsp; A casual pauper, half starved on a pint of
skilly, or &lsquo;a shocking case of destitution,&rsquo; and the
leading character in a coroner&rsquo;s inquest!&rdquo;&nbsp; All
this Master Timothy Mullins might urge, and beyond favouring him
with an extra month for contempt of court, what could the
magistrate do or say?</p>
<p>Swelling the ranks of juvenile thieves we find in large
numbers the thief-born.&nbsp; Writing on this subject, a reverend
gentleman of wisdom and experience says, &ldquo;Some are thieves
from infancy.&nbsp; Their parents are thieves in most cases; in
others, the children are orphans, or have been forsaken by their
parents, and in such cases the children generally fall into the
hands of the professional thief-trainer.&nbsp; In every low
criminal neighbourhood there are numbers of children who never
knew their parents, and who are fed and clothed by the old
thieves, and made to earn their wages by dishonest
practices.&nbsp; When the parent thieves are imprisoned or
transported, their children are left to shift for themselves, and
so fall into the hands of the thief-trainer.&nbsp; Here, then, is
one great source of crime.&nbsp; These children are nurtured in
it.&nbsp; They come under no good moral influence; and until the
ragged-schools were started, they had no idea of honesty, not to
mention morality and religion.&nbsp; Sharpened by hunger,
intimidated by severe treatment, and rendered adroit by vigilant
training, this class of thieves is perhaps the most numerous, the
most daring, the cleverest, and the most difficult to
reform.&nbsp; <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>In a moral point of view, these savages are much worse
off than the savages of the wilderness, inasmuch as all the
advantages of civilization are made to serve their criminal
habits.&nbsp; The poor, helpless little children literally grow
up into a criminal career, and have no means of knowing that they
are wrong; they cannot help themselves, and have strong claims on
the compassion of every lover of his species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly enough these seedling recruits of the criminal
population are the most difficult to reform.&nbsp; They are
impregnable alike to persuasion and threatening.&nbsp; They have
an ingrain conviction that it is <i>you</i> who are wrong, not
them.&nbsp; That you are wrong in the first place in
appropriating all the good things the world affords, leaving none
for them but what they steal; and in the next place, they regard
all your endeavours to persuade them to abandon the wretched life
of a thief for the equally poor though more creditable existence
of the honest lad, as humbug and selfishness.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
good feeling is ever allowed to predominate; all their passions
are distorted, all their faculties are perverted.&nbsp; They
believe the clergy are all hypocrites, the judges and magistrates
tyrants, and honest people their bitterest enemies.&nbsp;
Believing these things sincerely, and believing nothing else,
their hand is against every man, and the more they are imprisoned
the more is their dishonesty strengthened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is, indeed, a doleful summing up of our present position
and future prospects as regards so large a percentage of those we
build prisons for.&nbsp; It is somewhat difficult to avoid a
feeling of exasperation when, as an <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>honest man, and one who finds it at
times a sore pinch to pay rates and taxes, one contemplates the
ugly, hopeless picture.&nbsp; Still, we should never forget that
these are creatures who are criminal not by their own
seeking.&nbsp; They are as they were born and bred and nurtured,
and the only way of relieving society of the pest they are
against it, is to take all the care we may to guard against the
ravages of those we have amongst us, and adopt measures for the
prevention of their breeding a new generation.</p>
<p>How this may be accomplished is for legislators to
decide.&nbsp; Hitherto it has appeared as a phase of the criminal
question that has attracted very little attention on the part of
our law makers.&nbsp; They appear, however, to be waking up to
its importance at last.&nbsp; Recently, in the House of Lords,
Lord Romilly suggested that the experiment might be tried of
taking away from the home of iniquity they were reared in the
children of twice or thrice convicted thieves above the age of
ten years; taking them away for good and all and placing them
under State protection; educating them, and giving them a
trade.&nbsp; If I rightly recollect, his lordship&rsquo;s
suggestion did not meet with a particularly hearty
reception.&nbsp; Some of his hearers were of opinion that it was
setting a premium on crime, by affording the habitual thief just
that amount of domestic relief he in his selfishness would be
most desirous of.&nbsp; But Lord Romilly combated this objection
with the reasonable rejoinder, that by mere occupation the nature
of the thief was not abased below that of the brute, and that it
was fair to assume that so far from encouraging <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>him to
qualify himself for State patronage, his dread of having his
children taken from him might even check him in his iniquitous
career.</p>
<p>One thing, at least, is certain; it would come much
<i>cheaper</i> to the country if these budding burglars and
pickpockets were caught up, and caged away from the community at
large, before their natures became too thoroughly pickled in the
brine of rascality.&nbsp; Boy thieves are the most mischievous
and wasteful.&nbsp; They will mount a house roof, and for the
sake of appropriating the half-a-crown&rsquo;s worth of lead that
forms its gutter, cause such damage as only a builder&rsquo;s
bill of twenty pounds or so will set right.&nbsp; The other day a
boy stole a family Bible valued at fifty shillings, and after
wrenching off the gilt clasps, threw the book into a sewer; the
clasps he sold to a marine store dealer for <i>twopence
halfpenny</i>!&nbsp; It may be fairly assumed that in the case of
boy thieves, who are so completely in the hands of others, that
before they can &ldquo;make&rdquo; ten shillings in cash, they
must as a rule steal to the value of at least four pounds, and
sometimes double that sum.&nbsp; But let us put the loss by
exchange at its lowest, and say that he gets a fourth of the
value of what he steals, before he can earn eighteenpence a day,
he must rob to the amount of two guineas a week&mdash;a hundred
and nine pounds a year!&nbsp; Whatever less sum it costs the
State to educate and clothe and teach him, the nation would be in
pocket.</p>
<p>It would be idle to attempt to trace back to its origin the
incentive to crime in the class of small criminals here treated
of.&nbsp; Innocent of the meaning of the <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>term
&ldquo;strict integrity,&rdquo; they are altogether unconscious
of offending against it.&nbsp; They may never repent, for they
can feel no remorse for having followed the dictates of their
nature.&nbsp; No possible good can arise from piecing and
patching with creditable stuff the old cloak of sin they were
clothed in at their birth, and have worn ever since, till it has
become a second skin to them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Before they can be of
any real service as members of an honest community, they must be
<i>reformed</i> in the strictest sense of the term.&nbsp; Their
tainted morality must he laid bare to the very bones, as it were,
and its rotten foundation made good from its deepest layer.&nbsp;
The arduousness of this task it is hard to overrate; nothing,
indeed, can be harder, except it be to weed out from an adult
criminal the tough and gnarled roots of sin that grip and clasp
about and strangle his better nature.&nbsp; And this should be
the child criminal reformer&rsquo;s comfort and
encouragement.</p>
<p>It must not be imagined, however, that the growth of juvenile
criminality is altogether confined to those regions where it is
indigenous to the soil; were it so, our prospects of relief would
appear much more hopeful than at present, for, as before stated,
all that is necessary would be to sow the baleful ground with the
saving salt of sound and wholesome teaching, and the ugly
vegetation would cease.</p>
<p>But there are other and more formidable sources from which
flow the tributary streams that feed and keep at full flood our
black sea of crime; more formidable, because they do not take the
shape of irrepressible <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>springs that make for the surface,
simply because they are impelled thereto by forces they have not
the strength to combat against, but rather of well planned
artificial aqueducts and channels, and on the development of
which much of intellect is expended.&nbsp; It is much harder to
deal with the boy who, well knowing right from wrong, chooses the
latter, than with the boy who from the beginning has been wrong
from not knowing what right is.</p>
<p>Moreover, the boy who has been taught right from wrong, the
boy who has been sent to school and knows how to read, has this
advantage over his poor brother of the gutter&mdash;an advantage
that tells with inexpressible severity against the community at
large; he has trainers who, discovering his weakness, make it
their profit and business to take him by the hand and bring him
along in that path of life to which his dishonest inclination has
called him.</p>
<p>I allude to those low-minded, nasty fellows, the proprietors
and promoters of what may be truthfully described as
&ldquo;gallows literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a curse of London,
this one is worthy of a special niche in the temple of infamy,
and to rank first and foremost.&nbsp; The great difficulty would
be to find a sculptor of such surpassing skill as to be able to
pourtray in one carved stone face all the hideous vices and
passions that should properly belong to it.&nbsp; It is a stale
subject, I am aware.&nbsp; In my humble way, I have hammered at
it both in newspapers and magazines, and many better men have
done the same.&nbsp; Therefore it is stale.&nbsp; For no other
reason.&nbsp; The iniquity in itself is as vigorous and hearty as
ever, and every week renews its <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>brimstone leaves (meanwhile rooting
deeper and deeper in the soil that nourishes it), but
unfortunately it comes under the category of evils, the exposure
of which the public &ldquo;have had enough of.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
very provoking, and not a little disheartening, that it should be
so.&nbsp; Perhaps this complaint may be met by the answer: The
public are not tired of this one amongst the many abuses that
afflict its soul&rsquo;s health, it is only tired of being
reminded of it.&nbsp; Explorers in fields less difficult have
better fortune.&nbsp; As, for instance, the fortunate discoverer
of a gold field is.&nbsp; Everybody would be glad to shake him by
the hand&mdash;the hand that had felt and lifted the weight of
the nuggets and the yellow chips of dust; nay, not a few would be
willing to trim his finger nails, on the chance of their
discovering beneath enough of the auriferous deposit to pay them
for their trouble.&nbsp; But, to be sure, in a city of splendid
commercial enterprise such as is ours, it can scarcely be
expected that that amount of honour would be conferred on the man
who would remove a plague from its midst as on the one whose
magnificent genius tended to fatten the money-bags in the Bank
cellars.</p>
<p>At the risk, however, of being stigmatized as a man with a
weakness for butting against stone walls, I cannot let this
opportunity slip, or refrain from firing yet once again my small
pop-gun against this fortress of the devil.&nbsp; The reader may
have heard enough of the abomination to suit his taste, and let
him rest assured that the writer has written more than enough to
suit <i>his</i>; but if every man set up his &ldquo;taste&rdquo;
as the goal and summit of his striving, any tall fellow a tip-toe
might, after all, see over the heads <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>of most of us.&nbsp; The main
difficulty is that the tens and hundreds of thousands of boys who
stint a penny from its more legitimate use to purchase a dole of
the pernicious trash in question, have <i>not</i> &ldquo;had
enough of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing can be worse than this, except
it is that the purveyors of letter-press offal have not had
enough of it either, but, grown prosperous and muscular on the
good feeding their monstrous profits have ensured them, they are
continually opening up fresh ground, each patch fouler and more
pestilent than the last.</p>
<p>At the present writing I have before me half-a-dozen of these
penny weekly numbers of &ldquo;thrilling romance,&rdquo;
addressed to boys, and circulated entirely among them&mdash;and
girls.&nbsp; It was by no means because the number of these
poison pen&rsquo;orths on sale is small that a greater variety
was not procured.&nbsp; A year or so since, wishing to write a
letter on the subject to a daily newspaper, I fished out of one
little newsvendor&rsquo;s shop, situated in the nice convenient
neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, which, more than any other quarter
of the metropolis, is crowded with working children of both
sexes, the considerable number of <i>twenty-three</i> samples of
this gallows literature.&nbsp; But if I had not before suspected
it, my experience on that occasion convinced me that to buy more
than a third of that number would be a sheer waste of
pence.&nbsp; To be sure, to expect honest dealing on the part of
such fellows as can dabble in &ldquo;property&rdquo; of the kind
in question, is in the last degree absurd, but one would think
that they would, for &ldquo;business&rdquo; reasons, maintain
some show of giving a pen&rsquo;orth for a penny.&nbsp; <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Such is not
the case, however.&nbsp; In three instances in my twenty-three
numbers, I found the self-same story published <i>twice</i> under
a different title, while for at least half the remainder the
variance from their brethren is so very slight that nobody but a
close reader would discover it.</p>
<p>The six-pen&rsquo;orth before me include, &ldquo;The Skeleton
Band,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tyburn Dick,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Black Knight
of the Road,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dick Turpin,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Boy
Burglar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Starlight Sall.&rdquo;&nbsp; If I am
asked, is the poison each of these papers contains so cunningly
disguised and mixed with harmless-seeming ingredients, that a boy
of shrewd intelligence and decent mind might be betrayed by its
insidious seductiveness? I reply, no.&nbsp; The only subtlety
employed in the precious composition is that which is employed in
preserving it from offending the blunt nostrils of the law to
such a degree as shall compel its interference.&nbsp; If it is
again inquired, do I, though unwillingly, acknowledge that the
artful ones, by a wonderful exercise of tact and ingenuity, place
the law in such a fix that it would not be justified in
interfering?&nbsp; I most distinctly reply, that I acknowledge
nothing of the kind; but that, on the contrary, I wonder very
much at the clumsiness of a legislative machine that can let so
much scoundrelism slip through its cogs and snares.</p>
<p>The daring lengths these open encouragers of boy highwaymen
and Tyburn Dicks will occasionally go to serve their villanous
ends is amazing.&nbsp; It is not more than two or three years
since, that a prosperous member of the gang, whose business
premises were in, or within a few <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>doors of Fleet Street, by way of
giving a fair start to his published account of some thief and
murderer, publicly advertised that the buyers of certain numbers
would be entitled to a chance of a Prize in a grand distribution
of <i>daggers</i>.&nbsp; Specimens of the deadly weapons (made,
it may be assumed, after the same fashion as that one with which
&ldquo;flash Jack,&rdquo; in the romance, pinned the police
officer in the small of his back) were exhibited in the
publisher&rsquo;s shop window, and in due course found their way
into the hands of silly boys, with minds well primed for
&ldquo;daring exploits,&rdquo; by reading &ldquo;numbers 2 and 3
given away with number 1.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is altogether a mistake, however, to suppose that the
poison publisher&rsquo;s main element of success consists in his
glorification of robbers and cut-throats.&nbsp; To be sure he can
by no means afford to dispense with the ingredients mentioned in
the concoction of his vile brew, but his first and foremost
reliance is on lewdness.&nbsp; Everything is subservient to
this.&nbsp; He will picture to his youthful readers a hero of the
highway, so ferocious in his nature, and so reckless of
bloodshed, that he has earned among his comrades the flattering
nick-name of &ldquo;the Panther.&rdquo;&nbsp; He will reveal the
bold panther in all his glory, cleaving the skull of the
obstinate old gentleman in his travelling carriage, who will not
give up his money, or setting an old woman on the kitchen fire,
as a just punishment for hiding her guineas in the oven, in
fishing them out of which the panther burns his fingers; he will
exhibit the crafty &ldquo;panther&rdquo; wriggling his way
through the floor boards of his cell, into a sewer beneath, and
through <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>which he is to make his escape to the river, and then
by a flourish of his magic pen, he will convey the
&ldquo;panther&rdquo; to the &ldquo;boudoir&rdquo; of Starlight
Sall, and show you how weak a quality valour is in the presence
of &ldquo;those twin queens of the earth,&rdquo; youth and
beauty!&nbsp; The brave panther, when he has once crossed the
threshold of that splendid damsel (who, by the way, is a thief,
and addicted to drinking brandy by the &ldquo;bumper&rdquo;) is,
vulgarly speaking, &ldquo;nowhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; The haughty curl
of his lip, the glance of his eagle eye, &ldquo;the graceful
contour of his manly form,&rdquo; a mere gesture of which is
sufficient to quell rising mutiny amongst his savage crew, all
fall flat and impotent before the queenly majesty of Sall.&nbsp;
But there is no fear that the reader will lose his faith in
Panther Bill, because of this weakness confessed.&nbsp; As drawn
by the Author (does the pestiferous rascal so style himself, I
wonder?) Starlight Sall is a creature of such exquisite
loveliness, that Jupiter himself might have knelt before
her.&nbsp; She is such a matchless combination of perfection,
that it is found necessary to describe her charms separately, and
at such length that the catalogue of the whole extends through at
least six pages.</p>
<p>It is in this branch of his devilish business that the author
of &ldquo;Starlight Sall&rdquo; excels.&nbsp; It is evident that
the man&rsquo;s mind is in his work, and he lingers over it with
a loving hand.&nbsp; Never was there such a tender
anatomist.&nbsp; He begins Sall&rsquo;s head, and revels in her
auburn tresses, that &ldquo;in silken, snaky locks wanton
o&rsquo;er her shoulders, white as eastern ivory.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
is not profound in foreheads, and hers he passes over as
&ldquo;chaste as snow,&rdquo; <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>or in noses, Sall&rsquo;s being
described briefly as &ldquo;finely chiselled;&rdquo; but he is
well up in the language of eyes&mdash;the bad language.&nbsp; He
skirmishes playfully about those of Sall, and discourses of her
eyebrows as &ldquo;ebon brow,&rdquo; from which she launches her
excruciating shafts of love.&nbsp; He takes her by the
eye-lashes, and describes them as the &ldquo;golden fringe that
screens the gates of paradise,&rdquo; and finally he dips into
Sall&rsquo;s eyes, swimming with luscious languor, and pregnant
with tender inviting to Panther Bill, who was consuming in ardent
affection, as &ldquo;the rippling waves of the bright blue sea to
the sturdy swimmer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is impossible here to repeat
what else is said of the eyes of Starlight Sall, or her teeth,
&ldquo;like rich pearls,&rdquo; or of her &ldquo;pouting coral
lips, in which a thousand tiny imps of love are
lurking.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bear it in mind that this work of ours is
designed for the perusal of thinking men and women; that it is
not intended as an amusing work, but as an endeavour to pourtray
to Londoners the curses of London in a plain and unvarnished way,
in hope that they may be stirred to some sort of absolution from
them.&nbsp; As need not be remarked, it would be altogether
impossible to the essayer of such a task, if he were either
squeamish or fastidious in the handling of the material at his
disposal; but I <i>dare</i> not follow our author any further in
his description of the personal beauties of Starlight Sall.&nbsp;
Were I to do so, it would be the fate of this book to be flung
into the fire, and every decent man who met me would regard
himself justified in kicking or cursing me; and yet, good fathers
and mothers of England&mdash;and yet, elder brothers and grown
sisters, tons of this bird-lime of <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>the pit is vended in London every
day of the Christian year.</p>
<p>Which of us can say that <i>his</i> children are safe from the
contamination?&nbsp; Boys well-bred, as well as ill-bred, are
mightily inquisitive about such matters, and the chances are very
clear, sir, that if the said bird-lime were of a sort not more
pernicious than that which sticks to the fingers, we might at
this very moment find the hands of my little Tom and your little
Jack besmeared with it.&nbsp; Granted, that it is unlikely, that
it is in the last degree improbable, even; still, the remotest of
probabilities have before now shown themselves grim actualities,
and just consider for a moment the twinge of horror that would
seize on either of us were it to so happen!&nbsp; Let us for a
moment picture to ourselves our fright and bewilderment, if we
discovered that our little boys were feasting off this deadly
fruit in the secrecy of their chambers!&nbsp; Would it then
appear to us that it was a subject the discussion of which we had
&ldquo;had enough of&rdquo;?&nbsp; Should we be content,
<i>then</i>, to shrug our shoulders after the old style, and
exclaim impatiently against the barbarous taste of writers who
were so tiresomely meddlesome?&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; The pretty
consternation that would ensue on the appalling
discovery!&mdash;the ransacking of boxes and cupboards, to make
quite sure that no dreg of the poison, in the shape of an odd
page or so, were hidden away!&mdash;the painful examination of
the culprit, who never till now dreamt of the enormity of the
thing he had been doing!&mdash;the reviling and threatening that
would be directed <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>against the unscrupulous news-agent who had supplied
the pernicious pen&rsquo;orth!&nbsp; Good heavens! the tremendous
rumpus there would be!&nbsp; But, thank God, there is no fear of
<i>that</i> happening.</p>
<p>Is there not?&nbsp; What are the assured grounds of
safety?&nbsp; Is it because it stands to reason that all such
coarse and vulgar trash finds its level amongst the coarse and
vulgar, and could gain no footing above its own elevation?&nbsp;
It may so stand in reason, but unfortunately it is the
unreasonable fact that this same pen poison finds customers at
heights above its natural low and foul water-line almost
inconceivable.&nbsp; How otherwise is it accountable that at
least a <i>quarter of a million</i> of these penny numbers are
sold weekly?&nbsp; How is it that in quiet suburban
neighbourhoods, far removed from the stews of London, and the
pernicious atmosphere they engender; in serene and peaceful
semi-country towns where genteel boarding schools flourish, there
may almost invariably be found some small shopkeeper who
accommodatingly receives consignments of &ldquo;Blue-skin,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Mysteries of London,&rdquo; and unobtrusively
supplies his well-dressed little customer with these
full-flavoured articles?&nbsp; Granted, my dear sir, that your
young Jack, or my twelve years old Robert, have minds too pure
either to seek out or crave after literature of the sort in
question, but not unfrequently it is found without seeking.&nbsp;
It is a contagious disease, just as cholera and typhus and the
plague are contagious, and, as everybody is aware, it needs not
personal contact with a body stricken to convey either of these
<a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>frightful maladies to the hale and hearty.&nbsp; A
tainted scrap of rag has been known to spread plague and death
through an entire village, just as a stray leaf of &ldquo;Panther
Bill,&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lsquo;Tyburn Tree&rdquo; may sow the
seeds of immorality amongst as many boys as a town can
produce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are unregistered as well
&ldquo;registered&rdquo; thieves.&nbsp; How many of the former
make London their hunting-ground, it were much more difficult to
enumerate.&nbsp; Nor is it so much out of place as might at first
appear, to class both phases of rascality under one general
heading.&nbsp; We have to consider the sources from which are
derived our army of London thieves.&nbsp; It is not as though the
plague of them that afflicts was like other plagues, and showed
itself mild or virulent, according to well-defined and
ascertained provocatives.&nbsp; On the contrary, the crop of our
crime-fields is even more undeviating than our wheat or barley
crops.&nbsp; A grain of corn cast into the ground may fail, but
the seeds of vice implanted in kindly soil is bound to germinate,
unless the nature of the soil itself is altered.&nbsp; As already
stated, the number <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>of our London thieves has somewhat decreased of late
years, but it is merely to the extent of six or seven per
cent.&nbsp; If it is twenty thousand at the present time, this
day twelvemonths, allowing for the increased population, it will
be nineteen thousand, say.</p>
<p>Appalling as are the criminal returns for the city of London,
it would be a vain delusion to imagine that when the
&ldquo;twenty thousand&rdquo; have passed in review before us,
the whole of the hideous picture has been revealed.&nbsp; The
Government statistics deal only with &ldquo;professional
criminals;&rdquo; that class of persons, that is to say, who have
abandoned all idea of living honestly, and who, weighing the
probable consequences, resign themselves to a life of systematic
depredation, and study existing facilities, and likely new
inventions, just as the ingenious joiner or engineer does in an
honest way.</p>
<p>The all-important question being, what are the main sources
from which are derived with such steadiness and certainty,
recruits for the great criminal army, it would be as well to
inquire how much of dishonesty is permitted amongst us unchecked,
simply because it does not take precisely that shape and colour
it must assume before it so offends us that we insist on the
law&rsquo;s interference.&nbsp; It should perhaps tend to make us
more tender in our dealings with thieves denounced as such, and
convicted, and sent to prison, when we consider the thousands of
men of all grades who know honesty by name only, and who would at
the merest push of adversity slip off the straight path on which
for years past they have been no better than barefaced impostors
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>and
trespassers, and plunge at once into the miry ways of the
professed thieves.&nbsp; It ceases to be a wonder how constantly
vacancies in the ranks of crime are filled when we reflect on the
flimsy partition that screens so many seemingly honest men, and
the accidental rending of which would disclose a thief long
practised, and cool, and bold through impunity.&nbsp; There are
whole communities of men, constituting complete branches of our
social economy, on whom the taint of dishonesty rests, and their
masters are fully aware of it, and yet year after year they are
allowed to continue in the same employment.&nbsp; Nay, I think
that I may go as far as to assert that so complete is the
disbelief in the honesty of their servants by these masters, that
to the best of their ability they provide against loss by theft
by paying the said servants very little wages.&nbsp; A notable
instance of this is furnished by the omnibus conductors in the
service of the General Omnibus Company.&nbsp; It is not because
the company in question conducts its business more loosely than
other proprietors of these vehicles that I particularize it, but
because it is a public company in the enjoyment of many
privileges and monopolies, and the public have an undoubted right
to expect fair treatment from it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how
many omnibuses, each requiring a conductor, are constantly
running through the streets of London, but their number must be
very considerable, judging from the fact that the takings of the
London General Omnibus Company alone range from nine to ten
thousand pounds weekly.&nbsp; Now it is well known to the company
that their conductors rob them.&nbsp; A gentleman of my
acquaintance once submitted to the secretary of <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>the company
an ingenious invention for registering the number of passengers
an omnibus carried on each journey, but the secretary was unable
to entertain it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is of no use to us, sir,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;The machine we want is one that will make
our men <i>honest</i>, and that I am afraid is one we are not
likely to meet with.&nbsp; They <i>will</i> rob us, and we
can&rsquo;t help ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; And knowing this, the
company pay the conductor four shillings a day, the said day, as
a rule, consisting of <i>seventeen hours</i>&mdash;from eight one
morning till one the next.&nbsp; The driver, in consideration it
may be assumed of his being removed from the temptation of
handling the company&rsquo;s money, is paid six shillings a day,
but his opinion of the advantage the conductor still has over him
may be gathered from the fact that he expects the latter to pay
for any reasonable quantity of malt or spirituous liquor he may
consume in the course of a long scorching hot or freezing cold
day, not to mention a cigar or two and the invariable parting
glass when the cruelly long day&rsquo;s work is at an end.</p>
<p>It would likewise appear that by virtue of this arrangement
between the omnibus conductor and his employers, the interference
of the law, even in cases of detected fraud, is dispensed
with.&nbsp; It is understood that the London General Omnibus
Company support quite a large staff of men and women watchers,
who spend their time in riding about in omnibuses, and noting the
number of passengers carried on a particular journey, with the
view of comparing the returns with the conductor&rsquo;s
receipts.&nbsp; It must, therefore, happen that the detections of
fraud are numerous; but does the reader recollect ever <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>reading in
the police reports of a conductor being prosecuted for
robbery?</p>
<p>To be sure the Company may claim the right of conducting their
business in the way they think best as regards the interests of
the shareholders, but if that &ldquo;best way&rdquo; involves the
countenancing of theft on the part of their servants, which can
mean nothing else than the encouragement of thieves, it becomes a
grave question whether the interests of its shareholders should
be allowed to stand before the interests of society at
large.&nbsp; It may be that to prosecute a dishonest conductor is
only to add to the pecuniary loss he has already inflicted on the
Company, but the question that much more nearly concerns the
public is, what becomes of him when suddenly and in disgrace they
turn him from their doors?&nbsp; No one will employ him.&nbsp; In
a few weeks his ill-gotten savings are exhausted, and he, the man
who for months or years, perhaps, has been accustomed to treat
himself generously, finds himself without a sixpence, and, what
is worse, with a mark against his character so black and broad
that his chances of obtaining employment in the same capacity are
altogether too remote for calculation.&nbsp; The respectable
barber who declined to shave a coal-heaver on the ground that he
was too vulgar a subject to come under the delicate operations of
the shaver&rsquo;s razor, and who was reminded by the grimy one
that he had just before shaved a baker, justified his conduct on
the plea that his professional dignity compelled him to draw a
line <i>somewhere</i>, and that he drew it at bakers.&nbsp; Just
so the London General Omnibus Company.&nbsp; They draw the <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>line at
thieves rash and foolish.&nbsp; So long as a servant of theirs is
content to prey on their property with enough of discretion as to
render exposure unnecessary, he may continue their servant; but
they make it a rule never again to employ a man who has been so
careless as to be found out.</p>
<p>As has been shown, it is difficult to imagine a more
satisfactory existence than that of an omnibus conductor to a man
lost to all sense of honesty; on the other hand it is just as
difficult to imagine a man so completely &ldquo;floored&rdquo; as
the same cad disgraced, and out of employ.&nbsp; It is easy to
see on what small inducements such a man may be won over to the
criminal ranks.&nbsp; He has no moral scruples to overcome.&nbsp;
His larcenous hand has been in the pocket of his master almost
every hour of the day for months, perhaps years past.&nbsp; He is
not penitent, and if he were and made an avowal to that effect,
he would be answered by the incredulous jeers and sneers of all
who knew him.&nbsp; The best that he desires is to meet with as
easy a method of obtaining pounds as when he cheerfully drudged
for eighteen hours for a wage of four-shillings.&nbsp; This being
the summit of his ambition, presently he stumbles on what appears
even an easier way of making money than the old way, and he
unscrupulously appears not in a new character, but in that he has
had long experience in, but without the mask.</p>
<p>I should wish it to be distinctly understood, that I do not
include <i>all</i> omnibus conductors in this sweeping
condemnation.&nbsp; That there are honest ones amongst them I
make no doubt; at the same time I have no hesitation <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>in
repeating that in the majority of cases it is expected of them
that they will behave dishonestly, and they have no
disinclination to discredit the expectation.&nbsp; I believe too,
that it is much more difficult for a man to be honest as a
servant of the company than if he were in the employ of a
&ldquo;small master.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is next to impossible for a
man of integrity to join and work harmoniously in a gang of
rogues.&nbsp; The odds against his doing so may be calculated
exactly by the number that comprise the gang.&nbsp; It is not
only on principle that they object to him.&nbsp; Unless he
&ldquo;does as they do,&rdquo; he becomes a witness against them
every time he pays his money in.&nbsp; And he does as they
do.&nbsp; It is so much easier to do so than, in the condition of
a man labouring hard for comparatively less pay than a common
road-scraper earns, to stand up single handed to champion the
cause of honesty in favour of a company who are undisguisedly in
favour of a snug and comfortable compromise, and has no wish to
be &ldquo;bothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a great scandal that such a system should be permitted
to exist; and a body of employers mean enough to connive at such
bargain-making, can expect but small sympathy from the public if
the dishonesty it tacitly encourages picks it to the bones.&nbsp;
What are the terms of the contract between employer and
employed?&nbsp; In plain language these: &ldquo;We are perfectly
aware that you apply to us well knowing our system of doing
business, and with the deliberate intention of robbing us all you
safely can; and in self-defence, therefore, we will pay you as
what you may, if you please, regard as wages, <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span><i>two-pence three farthings an hour</i>, or four
shillings per day of seventeen hours.&nbsp; We know that the
probabilities are, that you will add to that four shillings daily
to the extent of another five or six.&nbsp; It is according to
our calculation that you will do so.&nbsp; Our directors have
arrived at the conclusion, that as omnibus conductors, of the
ordinary type, you cannot be expected to rob us of a less sum
than that, and we are not disposed to grumble so long as you
remain so moderate; but do not, as you value your situation with
all its accompanying privileges, go beyond that.&nbsp; As a man
who only robs us of say, five shillings a day, we regard you as a
fit and proper person to wait on our lady and gentleman
passengers; to attend to their convenience and comfort, in short,
as a worthy representative of the L. G. O. C.&nbsp; But beware
how you outstrip the bounds of moderation as we unmistakably
define them for you!&nbsp; Should you do so, we will kick you out
at a moment&rsquo;s notice, and on no consideration will we ever
again employ you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking this view of the case, the omnibus conductor, although
entitled to a foremost place in the ranks of thieves
non-professional, can scarcely be said to be the least excusable
amongst the fraternity.&nbsp; There are many who, looking down on
the &ldquo;cad&rdquo; from their pinnacle of high respectability,
are ten times worse than he is.&nbsp; Take the shopkeeper thief
for instance.&nbsp; He is by far a greater villain than the
half-starved wretch who snatches a leg of mutton from a
butcher&rsquo;s hook, or some article of drapery temptingly
flaunting outside the shop of the clothier, because in the one
case the crime is perpetrated <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>that a soul and a woefully lean body
may be saved from severance, and in the other case the iniquity
is made to pander to the wrong-doer&rsquo;s covetous desire to
grow fat, to wear magnificent jewellery, and to air his unwieldy
carcase annually at Margate.</p>
<p>He has enough for his needs.&nbsp; His deservings, such as
they are, most liberally attend him; but this is not
enough.&nbsp; The &ldquo;honest penny&rdquo; is very well to talk
about; in fact, in his cleverly assumed character of an upright
man, it is as well to talk about it loudly and not unfrequently,
but what fudge it is if you come to a downright blunt and
&ldquo;business&rdquo; view of the matter to hope ever to make a
fortune by the accumulation of &ldquo;honest
pennies!&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, thirty of the shabby things make no
more than half-a-crown if you permit each one to wear its plain
stupid face, whereas if you plate it neatly and tender
it&mdash;backed by your reputation for respectability, which your
banking account of course proves beyond a doubt&mdash;it will
pass as genuine silver, and you make two and five-pence at a
stroke!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t call it &ldquo;making,&rdquo; you
robbers of the counter and money-till, that is a vulgar
expression used by &ldquo;professional&rdquo; thieves; you allude
to it as &ldquo;cutting it fine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither do you
actually plate copper pennies and pass them off on the unwary as
silver half-crowns.&nbsp; Unless you were very hard driven
indeed, you would scorn so low and dangerous a line of
business.&nbsp; Yours is a much safer system of robbery.&nbsp;
You simply palm off on the unwary customer burnt beans instead of
coffee, and ground rice instead of arrowroot, and a mixture of
lard and turmeric instead of butter.&nbsp; You poison <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>the poor
man&rsquo;s bread.&nbsp; He is a drunkard, and you are not even
satisfied to delude him of his earnings for so long a time as he
may haply live as a wallower in beer and gin, that is beer and
gin as originally manufactured; you must, in order to screw a few
halfpence extra and daily out of the poor wretch, put grains of
paradise in his gin and coculus indicus in his malt liquor!&nbsp;
And, more insatiable than the leech, you are not content with
cheating him to the extent of twenty-five per cent. by means of
abominable mixtures and adulteration, you must pass him through
the mill, and cut him yet a little finer when he comes to
scale!&nbsp; You must file your weights and dab lumps of grease
under the beam, and steal an ounce or so out of his pound of
bacon.&nbsp; If you did this after he left your premises, if you
dared follow him outside, and stealthily inserting your hand into
his pocket abstracted a rasher of the pound he had just bought of
you, and he caught you at it, you would be quaking in the grasp
of a policeman in a very short time, and branded in the
newspapers as a paltry thief, you would never again dare loose
the bar of your shop shutters.&nbsp; But by means of your
dishonest scales and weights, you may go on stealing rashers from
morning till night, from Monday morning till Saturday night that
is, and live long to adorn your comfortable church pew on
Sundays.</p>
<p>I must be excused for sticking to you yet a little longer, Mr.
Shopkeeper Thief, because I hate you so.&nbsp; I hate you more
than ever, and you will be rejoiced when I tell you why.&nbsp; A
few months since, there seemed a chance that <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>your long
career of cruel robbery was about to be checked.&nbsp; An
excellent lord and gentleman, Lord E. Cecil, made it his business
to call the attention of the House of Commons to the state of the
law with respect to false weights and measures, and the
adulterations of food and drinks.&nbsp; His lordship informed
honourable members that the number of convictions for false
weights and measures during the past year amounted to the large
number of <i>thirteen hundred</i>, and this was exclusive of six
districts, namely: Southwark, Newington, St. George&rsquo;s,
Hanover Square, Paddington, and the Strand, which for reasons
best known to the local authorities, made no return
whatever.&nbsp; In Westminster alone, and within six months, a
hundred persons were convicted, and it was found that of these
twenty-four or nearly one-fourth of the whole were licensed
victuallers, and forty-seven were dairymen, greengrocers,
cheesemongers, and others, who supplied the poor with food,
making in all seventy per cent. of provision dealers.&nbsp; In
the parish of St. Pancras, the convictions for false weights and
measures exceed those of every other parish.&nbsp; But in future,
however much the old iniquity may prevail, the rogue&rsquo;s
returns will show a handsome diminution.&nbsp; This has been
managed excellently well by the shrewd vestrymen
themselves.&nbsp; When the last batch of shopkeeper-swindlers of
St. Pancras were tried and convicted, the ugly fact transpired
that not a few of them were gentlemen holding official positions
in the parish.&nbsp; This was serious.&nbsp; The meddlesome
fellows who had caused the disagreeable exposure were called a
&ldquo;leet jury,&rdquo; whose business it <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>was to
pounce on evil doers whenever they thought fit, once in the
course of every month.&nbsp; The vestry has power over this
precious leet jury, thank heaven! and after sitting in solemn
council, the vestrymen, some of them doubtless with light weights
confiscated and deficient gin and beer measures rankling in their
hearts, passed a resolution, that in future the leet jury was to
stay at home and mind its own business, until the vestry clerk
gave it liberty to go over the ground carefully prepared for
it.</p>
<p>Alluding to the scandalous adulteration of food, Lord E. Cecil
remarked, &ldquo;The right hon. gentleman, the President of the
Board of Trade, in one of his addresses by which he had
electrified the public and his constituents, stated that the
great panacea for the ills of the working class was a free
breakfast table.&nbsp; Now he, Lord E. Cecil, was the last person
in the world to object to any revision of taxation if it were
based upon really sound grounds.&nbsp; But with all due deference
to the right hon. gentleman, there was one thing of even more
importance, namely, a breakfast table free from all
impurities.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then his lordship proceeded to quote
innumerable instances of the monstrous and dangerous injustice in
question, very much to the edification of members assembled, if
reiterated &ldquo;cheers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hear, hear,&rdquo;
went for anything.&nbsp; This was promising, and as it should
be.&nbsp; As Lord Cecil remarked, &ldquo;when I asked myself why
it is that this great nation which boasts to be so practical, and
which is always ready to take up the grievances of other people,
has submitted so tamely to this monstrous and increasing evil, <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>the only
answer I could give was that what was everybody&rsquo;s business
had become nobody&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doubtless this
was the view of the case that every member present on the
occasion took, and very glad they must have been when they found
that what was everybody&rsquo;s business had become
somebody&rsquo;s business at last.</p>
<p>And what said the President of the Board of Trade when he came
to reply to the motion of Lord Cecil: &ldquo;That in the opinion
of the House it is expedient that Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government
should give their earliest attention to the wide-spread and most
reprehensible practice of using false weights and measures, and
of adulterating food, drinks, and drugs, with a view of amending
the law as regards the penalties now inflicted for those
offences, and of providing more efficient means for the discovery
and prevention of fraud&rdquo;?&nbsp; Did the right hon.
President promptly and generously promise his most cordial
support for the laudable object in view?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Amazing
as it may appear to the great host of working men that furnish
the shopkeeping rogue with his chief prey, and who to a man are
ready to swear by the right hon. gentleman, he did nothing of the
kind.&nbsp; He started by unhesitatingly expressing his opinion
that the mover of the question, quite unintentionally of course,
had much exaggerated the whole business.&nbsp; And further, that
although there might be particular cases in which great harm to
health and much fraud might possibly be shown, yet general
statements of the kind in question were dangerous, and almost
certain to be unjust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I am prepared to show,&rdquo; continued the hon.
<a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>gentleman, &ldquo;that the exaggeration of the noble
lord&mdash;I do not say intentional exaggeration, of
course&mdash;is just as great in the matter of weights and
measures as in that of adulteration.&nbsp; Probably he is not
aware that in the list of persons employing weights that are
inaccurate&mdash;I do not say fraudulent; no distinction is drawn
between those who are intentionally fraudulent and those who are
accidentally inaccurate, and that the penalty is precisely the
same and the offence is just as eagerly detected.&nbsp; Now the
noble lord will probably be surprised to hear that many persons
are fined annually, not because their weights are too small, but
because they are too large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably, however, his lordship, who has evidently given much
attention to the subject, is master of this as well as all other
branches of it, and is not so much surprised as it may be assumed
the less knowing President of the Board of Trade was when the
anomaly was brought under his notice.&nbsp; Probably Lord Cecil
is aware, that in a very large number of businesses, articles are
bought as well as sold by weight by the same shopkeeper and at
the same shop, in such case it is nothing very wonderful to
discover a weight of seventeen ounces to the pound.&nbsp;
Moreover, it may be unknown to Mr. Bright, but it is quite a
common trick with the dishonest shopkeeper to have means at hand
for adjusting his false weights at the very shortest
notice.&nbsp; It is not a difficult process.&nbsp; Weights are,
as a rule, &ldquo;justified&rdquo; or corrected by means of
adding to, or taking from, a little of the lead that is for this
purpose sunk in the hollow in which the weight-ring is
fixed.&nbsp; This leaden plug being <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>raised by the point of a knife,
nothing is easier than to add or withdraw a wedge of the same
material.&nbsp; The knife point raises the leaden lid, the knife
handle forces it down at a blow, and the trick is done.&nbsp; At
the same time, the coolest rogue with a knowledge that the
&ldquo;leet&rdquo; is only next door, cannot always manage his
conjuring deftly, and this may in not a few instances account for
the weight <i>more</i> than just.&nbsp; Besides, taking the most
liberal view of the matter, it would be manifestly dangerous to
allow a system of &ldquo;averages&rdquo; to do duty for strict
and rigid justice.&nbsp; The relations between customer and
shopkeeper would speedily fall into a sad muddle if the latter
were permitted to excuse himself for selling fifteen ounces
instead of a full pound of butter to-day, on the ground that he
has a seventeen ounce weight somewhere about, and the probability
that what he is short to-day the customer had over and above in
the pound of lard he bought yesterday.</p>
<p>Again, let us listen to Mr. Bright as an advocate of
self-protection.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the corporations and the
magistrates have not sufficient interest in the matter, if the
people who elect the corporation care so little about it, I think
that is fair evidence that the grievance is not near so extensive
and injurious and burdensome as it has been described by the
noble lord.&nbsp; My own impression with regard to adulteration
is, that it arises from the very great and, perhaps, inevitable
competition in business; and that to a large extent it is
prompted by the ignorance of customers.&nbsp; As the ignorance of
customers generally is diminishing, we may hope that <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>before long
the adulteration of food may also diminish.&nbsp; It is quite
impossible that you should have the oversight of the shops of the
country by inspectors, and it is quite impossible that you should
have persons going into shops to buy sugar, pickles, and cayenne
pepper, to get them analysed, and then to raise complaints
against shopkeepers and bring them before magistrates.&nbsp; If
men in their private business were to be tracked by government
officers and inspectors every hour in the day, life would not be
worth having, and I should recommend them to remove to another
country where they would not be subject to such
annoyance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a knowledge of the source from which this expression of
opinion as to commercial morality emanates, one is apt to
mistrust once reading it.&nbsp; Surely a line has been
inadvertently skipped, a line that contains the key of the
puzzle, and reveals the refined sarcasm that lurks beneath the
surface.&nbsp; But no&mdash;twice reading, thrice reading, fails
to shed any new lights on the mystery.&nbsp; Here is Mr. John
Bright, the President of the Board of Trade, the working
man&rsquo;s champion, and the staunch upholder of the right of
those who sweat in honest toil, to partake plentifully of untaxed
food and drink, putting forth an extenuation for those who, under
guise of honest trading, filch from the working man, and pick and
steal from his loaf, from his beer jug, from his sugar basin,
from his milk-pot, in short, from all that he buys to eat or
drink.&nbsp; &ldquo;My own impression is,&rdquo; says the Right
Hon. President, &ldquo;that adulteration arises from competition
in business.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very possibly, but does <i>that</i>
excuse <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>it?&nbsp; We are constantly reminded that
&ldquo;competition is the soul of trade,&rdquo; but we should be
loth to think that such were the fact if the term
&ldquo;competition&rdquo; is to be regarded as synonymous with
adulteration, or, in plain language, robbery.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
quite impossible that you should have persons going about
endeavouring to detect the dishonest tradesman in his
peculations, with a view to his punishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why is
it impossible?&nbsp; Must not the repose of this sacred
&ldquo;soul of business&rdquo; be disturbed, on so trivial a
pretext as the welfare of the bodies of a clodhopping people, who
are not commercial?&nbsp; So far from its being
&ldquo;impossible&rdquo; to substitute vigilant measures for the
detection of the petty pilferer who robs the poor widow of a
ha&rsquo;porth of her three penn&rsquo;orth of coals, or the
fatherless child of a slice out of its meagre allowance of bread,
it should be regarded by the Government as amongst its chief
duties.&nbsp; Other nations find it not impossible.&nbsp; In
France a commissary of police has the right to enter any shop,
and seize any suspected article, bearing of course all the
responsibility of wrongful seizure.&nbsp; In Prussia, as Lord
Cecil informed the House, &ldquo;whoever knowingly used false
weights and measures was liable to imprisonment for three months,
to be fined from fifty to a thousand thalers, and to suffer the
temporary loss of his rights of citizenship.&nbsp; Secondly,
where false weights and measures were not regularly employed, a
fine of thirty thalers may be imposed, or the delinquent sent to
prison for four weeks.&nbsp; Thirdly, the adulteration of food or
drink is punishable with a fine of 150 thalers, or six
weeks&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; Fourthly, if poisonous matter <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>or stuff be
employed, the offender is liable to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding ten years.&nbsp; Fifthly, where adulteration was proved
to have caused severe physical injury, a sentence of from ten to
twenty years&rsquo; imprisonment might be passed.&nbsp; And yet
in this country offences of this nature could only be punished by
the imposition of a penalty of a fine of &pound;5, with
costs.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are not laws of yesterday.&nbsp; They
have stood the test of many years, and French and Prussians find
it not &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; to continue their salutary
enforcement.&nbsp; But it is curious the extraordinary view men
in authority amongst us at times take of the licence that should
be permitted the &ldquo;trader.&rdquo;&nbsp; I remember once
being present at a County Court, and a case tried was that
between a wholesale mustard dealer and a cookshop keeper.&nbsp;
The cookshop keeper declined to pay for certain mustard delivered
to him on the ground that his customers would not eat it.&nbsp;
Indeed, it could hardly be called mustard at all, being little
else than flour coloured with turmeric, and, backed by medical
testimony, the defendant mainly relied on this point,
<i>i.e.</i>, that it was not mustard at all, for a verdict.&nbsp;
But the judge would not hear of this; in his summing up he
remarked that it was idle to contend that the stuff was
<i>not</i> mustard; <i>it was mustard in a commercial sense</i>,
whatever might be its quality, and thereon gave a verdict for the
plaintiff, and for the amount claimed.</p>
<p>I must confess that at the time I had my doubts as to this
being sound law, but after the declaration of the President of
the Board of Trade, I am bound to admit the possibility of my
being mistaken.&nbsp; &ldquo;Competition is <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>the soul of
commerce;&rdquo; competition is the parent of adulteration;
adulteration is theft as a rule,&mdash;murder as an
exception.&nbsp; The loaf that is composed of inferior flour,
rice, potatoes, and alum, is the &ldquo;wheaten bread&rdquo; of
&ldquo;commerce.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poisonous liquid composed of a
little malt and hops, eked out with treacle and <i>coculus
indicus</i>, is the beer of &ldquo;commerce.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
according to the same ruling, a lump of lard stuck under the
butter-shop scale, or the inch snipped off the draper&rsquo;s
yard, or the false bottom to the publican&rsquo;s pot, constitute
the weights and measures of &ldquo;commerce.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
these little harmless tricks of trade are, it seems, within the
scope of a tradesman&rsquo;s &ldquo;private business,&rdquo; and
according to the President of the Board of Trade, if a tradesman
in pursuit of his private business is to be watched and spied
over for the malicious purpose of bringing him within the grasp
of the law, why the sooner he quits the country, and settles
amongst a more easy-going people, with elbow-room proper for his
commercial enterprise, the better for him.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the better for him and the better for us.&nbsp; I
would make this difference, however.&nbsp; When his iniquity was
discovered, he should not go altogether unrewarded for his past
services.&nbsp; He should be assisted in his going abroad.&nbsp;
He should not be called on to pay one penny for his outward
passage, and, what is more, he should be supplied with
substantial linsey-wolsey clothing, and his head should be
cropped quite close, so that the scorching sun of Bermuda or
Gibraltar might not upset his brain for future commercial
speculation.</p>
<p>It needs, however, something more persuasive than the <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&ldquo;mustard of commerce&rdquo; to induce us to
swallow with satisfaction the President&rsquo;s assertion, that
&ldquo;to a large extent adulteration is promoted by the
ignorance of customers,&rdquo; nor are we immensely consoled by
the suggestion that &ldquo;as the ignorance of the customer
diminishes, the adulteration of food will also
diminish.&rdquo;&nbsp; Decidedly this is a bright look out for
the ignorant customer!&nbsp; There is to be no help for him, no
relief.&nbsp; He must endure to be cheated in weight and measure,
and slowly poisoned in the beer he drinks, and the bread he eats,
until he finds time and money to provide himself with a
scientific education, and becomes an accomplished scholar in
chemistry, able to detect adulteration at sight or smell.&nbsp;
Is this what the President of the Board of Trade means, or what
is it?&nbsp; He cannot mean that the imposture is endured because
the consumer will not take the trouble to avail himself of the
laws made for his protection, because he is distinctly informed
that although there are such laws, they are rendered inoperative
because of the &ldquo;impossibility&rdquo; of having inspectors
and detectives going about prying into the &ldquo;private
business&rdquo; of the shopkeeper, and annoying him.&nbsp; If the
ignorance of the honest man is to be regarded as the fair
opportunity of the rogue, then there appears no reason why the
immunity enjoyed by the fraudulent shopkeeper should not likewise
be the indulgence allowed to the professional thief.&nbsp; It is
the &ldquo;ignorance of the customer&rdquo; that enables the
cheat to impose on him bad money for good, or a forged signature
for one that is genuine.&nbsp; It is the ignorance of the green
young man from the country as regards the wicked <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>ways of
London, that enables the skittle sharper to fleece him with ease
and completeness.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, if we were all equally
&ldquo;wide awake,&rdquo; as the vulgar saying is, if no one had
the advantage of his neighbour as regards cunning, and
shrewdness, and suspicion, and all the other elements that
constitute &ldquo;a man of the world,&rdquo; then the trade of
cheating would become so wretched a one that even ingrain rogues
would for their life-sake cultivate the sort of honesty that was
prevalent as the best policy, though very much against their
natural inclination; but it might possibly be found that there
are thousands and tens of thousands of simple people who would
prefer to remain in &ldquo;ignorance,&rdquo; having no desire to
become &ldquo;men of the world&rdquo; in the sense above
indicated, and electing for their souls&rsquo;-sake to be lambs
with a fleece to lose, than ravening wolves, whose existence
depends on the fleecing of lambs.</p>
<p><i>Apropos</i> of the practice of cheating by means of the
adulteration of foods and drinks, it may not be out of place here
to mention that during the discussion a member in whom Mr. Bright
expressed great confidence, announced that the use of alum in
bread, so far from being injurious, was <i>positively
beneficial</i>.&nbsp; Doctor Letheby, however, is of a somewhat
different opinion.&nbsp; Recently, at the Society of Arts, he
read a paper on the subject.&nbsp; Here are his opinions on the
matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By the addition of alum, inferior and even
damaged flour may be made into a tolerable looking loaf.&nbsp; It
is the property of alum to make the gluten tough, and to prevent
its discoloration by heat, as well as to check the action of the
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>yeast or
ferment upon it.&nbsp; When, therefore, it is added to good
flour, it enables it to hold more water, and so to yield a larger
number of loaves; while the addition of it to bad flour prevents
the softening and disintegrating effect of the yeast on the poor
and inferior gluten, and so enables it to bear the action of heat
in the progress of baking.&nbsp; According to the quality of
flour, will be the proportion of alum, and hence the amount will
range from 2 ozs. to 8 ozs. per sack of flour.&nbsp; These
proportions will yield from 9 to 37 grains of alum in the
quartern loaf, quantities which are easily detected by chemical
means.&nbsp; Indeed, there is a simple test by which much smaller
quantities of it may be readily discovered.&nbsp; You have only
to dip a slice of the bread into a weak solution of logwood in
water, and if alum be present, the bread will speedily acquire a
red or purplish tint.&nbsp; Good bread should not exhibit any
black specks upon its upper crust; it should not become sodden
and wet at the lower part by standing; it should not become
mouldy by keeping in a moderately dry place; it should be sweet
and agreeable to the taste and smell; it should not give, when
steeped, a ropy, acid liquor; and a slice of it taken from the
centre of the loaf should not lose more than forty-five per cent.
by drying.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, speaking of the cruelty and dishonesty of the various
&ldquo;sophistications&rdquo; practised by the vendors of food as
regards the inefficacy of the laws made for its suppression, the
good doctor says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Parliament has attempted to deal with the
matter by legislation, as in the &lsquo;Act for Preventing the
Adulteration <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>of Articles of Food or Drink&rsquo; of 1860; but as the
Act is only permissive, little or no effect has been given to
it.&nbsp; Even in those places, as in the City of London, where
it has been put into operation, and public analysts have been
appointed, no good has resulted from it; in fact, it stands upon
the statute-book as a dead letter.&nbsp; Speaking of the City, I
may say that every inducement has been offered for the effective
working of the Act, but nothing has come of it.&nbsp; In olden
times, the remedies for such misdemeanours were quick and
effectual.&nbsp; In the <i>Assisa panis</i>, for example, as set
forth in <i>Liber Albus</i>, there are not only the strictest
regulations concerning the manner in which the business of the
baker is to be conducted, but there are also penalties for
failing in the same.&nbsp; &lsquo;If any default,&rsquo; it says,
&lsquo;shall be found in the bread of a baker in the city, the
first time, let him be drawn upon a hurdle from the Guildhall to
his own house through the great streets where there be most
people assembled; and through the great streets which are most
dirty, with the faulty loaf hanging about his neck.&nbsp; If a
second time he shall be found committing the same offence, let
him be drawn from the Guildhall, through the great street of
Chepe in manner aforesaid to the pillory, and let him be put upon
the pillory and remain there at least one hour in the day; and
the third time that such default shall be found, he shall be
drawn, and the oven shall be pulled down, and the baker made to
forswear the trade within the city for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
further tells us, that William de Stratford suffered this
punishment for selling bread of short weight, and John de Strode
&lsquo;for making bread of filth and <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>cobwebs.&rsquo;&nbsp; One
hoary-headed offender was excused the hurdle on account of his
age and the severity of the season; and it would seem that the
last time the punishment was inflicted was in the sixteenth year
of the reign of Henry VI., when Simon Frensshe was so
drawn.&nbsp; A like punishment was awarded to butchers and
vintners for fraudulent dealings; for we are told that a butcher
was paraded through the streets with his face to the
horse&rsquo;s tail for selling measly bacon at market, and that
the next day he was set in the pillory with two great pieces of
his measly bacon over his head, and a writing which set forth his
crimes.&nbsp; In the judgments recorded in <i>Liber Albus</i>
there are twenty-three cases in which the pillory was awarded for
selling putrid meat, fish, or poultry; thirteen for unlawful
dealings of bakers, and six for the misdemeanours of vintners and
wine dealers.&nbsp; Verily we have degenerated in these
matters.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And while we are on the subject of thieves non-professional,
and their easy conversion to the article legally stamped and
recognised, it may not be amiss briefly to remark on the odd
ideas of honesty entertained and practised by thousands of our
hard-fisted, and except for the singular weakness hinted at,
quite worthy and decent &ldquo;journeymen.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
curious how much of hallucination prevails amongst us on the
subject of &ldquo;common honesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is as though
there were several qualities of that virtue,
&ldquo;common,&rdquo; &ldquo;middling,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;superfine,&rdquo; as there are in household bread; and
that, carrying out the simile, although the
&ldquo;superfine&rdquo; is undoubtedly nicer, and what one would
always use if he could afford it, the honesty <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>dubbed
&ldquo;common&rdquo; is equally wholesome, and on the whole the
only sort on which it is possible for a working man to exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am as honest as I can afford to be,&rdquo; is an
observation common in the mouth of those who really and truly
earn their bread and acquire a creditable reputation by the sweat
of their brow.&nbsp; It never seems to occur to them that such an
admission is equal to a confession of dishonesty, and since it is
simply a matter of degree, that the common thief on the same
grounds may claim the privilege of shaking them by the hand as
their equal.&nbsp; The man who fixes the standard of his honesty
at no greater height becomes an easy prey to temptation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If he is as honest as he can afford to be,&rdquo; and no
more, it simply means that his means not being equal to his
necessities he has already admitted the thin end of the wedge of
dishonesty to make good the gap, and that should the said gap
unhappily widen, the wedge must enter still further in until a
total splitting up of the system ensues, and the wedge itself
becomes the only steadfast thing to cling to.</p>
<p>That this melancholy consummation is not more frequently
attained is the great wonder, and would tend to show that many
men adopt a sort of hobbling compromise, walking as it were with
one foot on the path of rectitude, and the other in the miry way
of petty theft, until they get to the end of life&rsquo;s tether
and both feet slip into the grave.</p>
<p>It is a fact at once humiliating, but there it stands stark
and stern, and will not be denied, that there are daily <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>pursuing
their ordinary business, and passing as honest, hundreds and
thousands of labouring folk, who, if their various malversations
were brought to light, and they were prosecuted, would find
themselves in prison ere they were a day older.&nbsp; Nor should
this startle us very much, as we are well aware of it, and mayhap
are in no small degree responsible for it, since it is mainly
owing to our indolent disregard that the evil has become so
firmly established; at the same time it should be borne in mind,
that this no more excuses those who practise and profit on our
indifference to small pilferings than a disinclination to
prosecute a professional pickpocket mitigates the offence of the
delinquent.</p>
<p>The species of dishonesty alluded to, as not coming within the
official term &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; has many aliases.&nbsp;
Ordinarily it is called by the cant name of &ldquo;perks,&rdquo;
which is a convenient abbreviation of the word
&ldquo;perquisites,&rdquo; and in the hands of the users of it,
it shows itself a word of amazing flexibility.&nbsp; It applies
to such unconsidered trifles as wax candle ends, and may be
stretched so as to cover the larcenous abstraction by our
man-servant of forgotten coats and vests.&nbsp; As has been
lately exposed in the newspapers, it is not a rare occurrence for
your butler or your cook to conspire with the roguish tradesman,
the latter being permitted to charge &ldquo;his own
prices,&rdquo; on condition that when the monthly bill is paid,
the first robber hands over to the second two-shillings or
half-a-crown in the pound.&nbsp; It is not, however, these sleek,
and well-fed non-professional thieves that I would just now speak
of, but <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>rather of the working man&mdash;the journeyman tailor
for example.</p>
<p>Did anyone ever yet hear of a working tailor who was proof
against misappropriation of his neighbour&rsquo;s goods, or as he
playfully designates it, &ldquo;cabbage?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not a
standard joke in the trade this &ldquo;cabbage?&rdquo;&nbsp; Did
one ever hear of a tailor being shunned by his fellow-workmen, or
avoided by his neighbours, on account of his predilection for
&ldquo;cabbage?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet what is it but another word for
&ldquo;theft?&rdquo;&nbsp; If I entrust a builder with so much
timber, and so much stone, and so many bricks, to build me a
house, and I afterwards discover that by clever dodging and
scheming he has contrived to make me believe that all the
material I gave him has been employed in my house, whereas he has
managed to filch enough to build himself a small cottage, do I
accept his humorous explanation that it is only
&ldquo;cabbage,&rdquo; and forgive him?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I regard
it as my duty to afford him an opportunity of explaining the
matter to a magistrate.&nbsp; But if I entrust my tailor with
stuff for a suit, and it afterwards comes to my knowledge that he
has &ldquo;screwed&rdquo; an extra waistcoat out of it, which he
keeps or sells for his own benefit, do I regard it as a serious
act of robbery?&nbsp; I am ashamed to say that I do not; I may
feel angry, and conceive a contempt for tailors, but I take no
steps to bring the rogue to justice.&nbsp; I say to myself,
&ldquo;It is a mean trick, but they all do it,&rdquo; which is
most unjust to the community of tailors, because though I may
suspect that they all do it, I have no proof of the fact, whereas
I have proof that there is a dishonest tailor in their <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>guild, and
I have no right to assume but that they would regard it as a
favour if I would assist them in weeding him out.</p>
<p>And it is almost as good a joke as the calling downright theft
by the comical name of &ldquo;cabbage,&rdquo; that the tailor
will do this and all the time insist on his right to be classed
with honest men.&nbsp; He insists on this because he was never
known to steal anything besides such goods as garments are made
out of.&nbsp; As he comes along bringing your new suit home he
would think it no sin to call at that repository for stolen goods
the &ldquo;piece broker&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and sell there a strip of
your unused cloth for a shilling, but you may safely trust him in
the hall where the hats and umbrellas and overcoats are.&nbsp; He
would as soon think of breaking into your house with crowbars and
skeleton keys, as of abstracting a handkerchief he saw peeping
out of a pocket of one of the said coats.</p>
<p>As with the tailor, so it is with the upholsterer, and the
dressmaker, and the paperhanger, and the plumber, and all the
rest of them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say that every time they take a
shred of this, or a pound weight of that, that they have before
their eyes the enormity of the offence they are about to
commit.&nbsp; What they do they see no great harm in.&nbsp;
Indeed, point out to them and make it clear that their offence
has but to be brought fairly before the criminal authorities to
ensure them a month on the treadmill, and they would as a rule be
shocked past repeating the delinquency.&nbsp; And well would it
be if they were shocked past it, ere misfortune overtake
them.&nbsp; It is when &ldquo;hard up&rdquo; times set in, and it
is difficult indeed <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>to earn an honest penny, that these
rudimentary exercises in the art of pillage tell against a
man.&nbsp; It is then that he requires his armour of proof
against temptation, and lo! it is full of holes and rust-eaten
places, and he falls at the first assault of the enemy.</p>

&ldquo;<i>Mother</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Dark Cell and its
Inmate</i>.&mdash;<i>An Affecting Interview</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> less an authority than Lord
Romilly, discoursing on the alarming prevalence and increase of
crime, especially amongst the juveniles of the criminal class,
remarks: &ldquo;It is a recognised fact, that there is a great
disposition on the part of children to follow the vocation of
their father, and in the case of the children of thieves there is
no alternative.&nbsp; They become thieves, because they are
educated in the way, and have no other trade to apply themselves
to.&nbsp; To strike at the root of the evil, I would suggest,
that if a man committed felony, all his children under the age,
say of ten, should be taken from him, and educated at the expense
of the State.&nbsp; It might perhaps be said, that a man who
wanted to provide for his children, need in that case only to
commit felony to <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>accomplish his object, but I believe that the effect
would be just the contrary.&nbsp; I believe that no respectable
person would commit felony for such a purpose, and that if we
knew more about the feelings of thieves, we should find that they
had amongst them a species of morality, and displayed affection
for their children.&nbsp; My opinion is, that to take their
children away from them would be an effectual mode of punishment;
and though the expense might be great, it would be repaid in a
few years by the diminution in crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Lord Romilly&rsquo;s opinions on this subject may be
somewhat in advance of those commonly prevalent, there can be no
question that they tend in the right direction.&nbsp; Crime may
be suppressed, but it can never be exterminated by simply lopping
the flourishing boughs and branches it puts forth; it should be
attacked at the root, and the thief child is the root of the
adult growth, tough, strong-limbed, and six feet high.&nbsp;
Precisely the same argument as that used as regards the abolition
of neglected children applies in the case of the infant born in
crime.&nbsp; The nest in which for generations crime has bred
should be destroyed.&nbsp; It is only, however, to the initiated
that the secluded spots where these nests may be found is
known.&nbsp; A correspondent of the <i>Times</i> lately made an
exploration, from the report of which the following is an
extract.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was shown in the east and south sides of
London what I may almost say were scores of men, about whom the
detectives, who accompanied me, expressed grave doubts as to my
life being safe among them <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>for a single hour, if it were known
I had &pound;20 or &pound;30 about me; and above all, if the
crime of knocking me on the head could be committed under such
circumstances as would afford fair probabilities of eluding
detection.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to say that these desperate
criminals are confined to any particular quarter of London;
unfortunately they are not, or if they were, there is only one
particular quarter in which we should wish to see them all
confined, and that is Newgate.&nbsp; But no matter how numerous
they may be elsewhere, there is certainly one quarter in which
they are pre-eminently abundant, and that is around the alleys of
the Borough.&nbsp; Here are to be found, not only the lowest
description of infamous houses, but the very nests and nurseries
of crime.&nbsp; The great mass of the class here is simply
incorrigible.&nbsp; Their hand is against every man; their life
is one continuous conspiracy against the usages of property and
safety of society.&nbsp; They have been suckled, cradled and
hardened in scenes of guilt, intemperance, and profligacy.&nbsp;
Here are to be found the lowest of the low class of beershops in
London, and probably in the world, the acknowledged haunts of
&ldquo;smashers,&rdquo; burglars, thieves and forgers.&nbsp;
There is hardly a grade in crime, the chief representatives of
which may not be met among the purlieus of the Borough.&nbsp;
There are people who have been convicted over and over again, but
there are also hundreds of known ruffians who are as yet
unconvicted, and who, by marvellous good luck, as well as by
subtle cunning, have managed up to the present time to elude
detection.&nbsp; It is the greatest error to suppose that all, or
even a majority of the criminal <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>classes are continually passing
through the hands of justice.&nbsp; Griffith, the hank-note
forger, who was tried, I think, in 1862, stated in prison that he
had carried on the printing of counterfeit notes for more than 15
years.&nbsp; Of course this man was sedulous in concealing his
occupation from the police, but there are hundreds of others who
almost openly follow equally criminal and far more dangerous
pursuits with whom the police cannot interfere.&nbsp; Our present
business should be to look up these vagabonds, and our future
vocation to destroy their recognised haunts.&nbsp; It is no good
killing one wasp when we leave the nest untouched.&nbsp; Thieves,
it must be remembered, are a complete fraternity, and have a
perfect organization among themselves.&nbsp; The quarter round
Kent Street, in the Borough, for instance, is almost wholly
tenanted by them, and the houses they occupy are very good
property, for thieves will pay almost any amount of rent, and pay
it regularly, for the sake of keeping together.&nbsp; The aspect
of this quarter is low, foul and dingy.&nbsp; Obscurity of
language and conduct is of course common to all parts of it, but
it is not as a rule a riotous neighbourhood.&nbsp; Thieves do not
rob each other, and they have a wholesome fear of making rows,
lest it should bring the police into their notorious
territory.&nbsp; These haunts are not only the refuges and
abiding places of criminals, but they are the training colleges
for young thieves.&nbsp; Apart from the crimes which arise, I
might say almost naturally from passion or poverty&mdash;apart
also from the mere relaxation of moral culture, caused by the
daily exhibition of apparent success in crime, it is known that
an organized corruption <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>is carried on by the adult thieves
among the lads of London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is by laying hands on these children, and providing them
with employment, the pleasurable exercise of which shall of
itself convince them how infinitely superior as a
&ldquo;policy&rdquo; honesty is to be preferred to that which
consigned their father to Portland, that we may do more good than
by the concoction of as many legislative enactments as have had
birth since Magna Charta.&nbsp; Of the children who are not the
progeny of thieves, but who somehow find their way into the
criminal ranks, it is undoubtedly true that pernicious
literature, more than once alluded to in these pages, does much
to influence them towards evil courses.&nbsp; This is a belief
that is justified, not alone by observation and inference, but by
the confession of juvenile prisoners themselves.&nbsp; It is a
fact that at least fifty per cent. of the young thieves lodged in
gaol, when questioned on the subject, affect that it was the
shining example furnished by such gallows heroes as &ldquo;Dick
Turpin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blueskin,&rdquo; that first beguiled
them from the path of rectitude, and that a large proportion of
their ill-gotten gains was expended in the purchase of such
delectable biographies.</p>
<p>This, however, is ground that should be trod with
caution.&nbsp; Useful as such revelations may be in guiding us
towards conclusions on which vigorous action may be based, it
should be constantly borne in mind that it is not all pure and
untainted truth that proceeds from the mouths of the juvenile
habitual criminal in gaol any more than from his elders under the
same conditions.&nbsp; A talent <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>for gammoning &ldquo;Lady
Green,&rdquo; as the prison chaplain is irreverently styled, is
highly appreciated amongst the thieving fraternity.&nbsp; Boys
are as quick-witted as men in their way, and on certain matters
much quicker.&nbsp; They are less doggedly obstinate than most
adults of the same class, and more keenly alive to mischief,
especially when its practice may bring them some benefit.&nbsp; I
have witnessed several instances of this, and many others have
been brought under my notice by prison officials.&nbsp; As, for
instance, in a certain gaol that shall be nameless, the governor
has a fixed conviction that the one huge fountain head of
juvenile depravity is the tobacco pipe.&nbsp; And ample indeed
are his grounds for such conclusion, since almost every boy that
comes into his custody testifies to his sagacity.&nbsp; His old
customers never fail.&nbsp; He invariably questions the male
delinquent on the subject, and as invariably he gets the answer
he expects, and which favours his pet theory: &ldquo;It is all
through smoking, sir; I never knowed what bad &rsquo;abits was
afore I took to &lsquo;bacca.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The
probabilities, however, are that the little villains are aware of
the governor&rsquo;s weakness, and humour it.</p>
<p>It would seem so the more, because these same boys when
quartered in another gaol, the master of which rode a hobby of
another pattern, alter their tune so as to meet the
emergency.&nbsp; There is a prison in the suburbs of London, one
of the largest, and as far as I have had opportunity of judging,
one of the best managed and conducted; but the governor of it has
his boy-weakness.&nbsp; He is quite convinced in his own mind
that the main spring of crime <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>is the perusal of the sort of
literature herein alluded to.&nbsp; This is a fact generally
known among the juvenile criminal population, and they never fail
to make the most of it when the time comes.&nbsp; I went the
rounds of his gaol with this governor on one occasion, when the
&ldquo;boy wing&rdquo; was occupied by about forty tenants, and
in each case was the important question put, and in the majority
of cases it was answered, &ldquo;It was them there penny numbers
what I used to take in, sir,&rdquo; or words to that effect, and
the little humbug was rewarded by a pat on the head, and an
admonition &ldquo;always to speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same gentleman has another peculiarity; it does not
deserve to be stigmatised a weakness, its nature is so
amiable.&nbsp; He has a firm belief that the best way of
&ldquo;breaking&rdquo; a bad boy, is to appeal to his bygone
affection for his mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;The boy who is callous to
an appeal of that sort is past hope in my opinion,&rdquo; said
the worthy governor, and in justice to the lads at the time in
his keeping, I must confess that there was not a callous one
amongst them, for they all most dutifully wept, in some cases
bellowed as loudly as the stern restriction of the silent system
would permit, as soon as the delicate subject was broached.</p>
<p>The effect of this talisman was curiously exhibited in the
case of a boy, about as depraved and hardened a little wretch as
it is possible to imagine.&nbsp; He had only been admitted the
previous day, and already he was incarcerated in a dark cell for
outrageous conduct.</p>
<p>I had never before seen a dark cell, and therefore had no idea
of the horrible place it was.&nbsp; A cell within a <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>cell.&nbsp;
The interior of the first is so black that when the governor
entered it I speedily lost sight of him, and I was only made
aware of his opening an inner door by hearing the key clicking in
the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out here, lad,&rdquo; he exclaimed firmly, but
kindly.</p>
<p>The lad came out, looming like a small and ragged patch of
twilight in utter blackness until he gradually appeared before
us.&nbsp; He was not a big lad, not more than thirteen years old,
I should say, with a short-cropped bullet-head, and with an old
hard face with twice thirteen years of vice in it.</p>
<p>The prison dress consisted of a sort of blouse and trousers,
both of a stout woollen material of slate colour.&nbsp; It was
evening, and evidently, the captive, hopeless of release that
night, had, previously to our disturbing him, composed himself
for slumber.&nbsp; His method, doubtless derived from frequent
experience of so disposing his attire as to get as much warmth
out of it as possible, was somewhat curious: he had released his
trousers of their braces, so that they descended below his feet,
and the collar of his blouse was pulled up high over his
ears.&nbsp; Owing to his embarrassed habiliments, he shambled out
of the pitchy blackness at a snail&rsquo;s pace, his white cotton
braces trailing behind like a tail, and completing his
goblin-like appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very bad lad, sir,&rdquo; remarked the
governor sternly; &ldquo;he only came in yesterday, and to-day
while out for exercise with the others, he must misconduct
himself, and when the warder reproved him, he must swear <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>some
horrible oath against him.&nbsp; It is for that he is here.&nbsp;
How many times have you been here, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i> (gulping desperately).&nbsp; &ldquo;Three times,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Governor</i> (sternly).&nbsp; &ldquo;What! speak the truth,
lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i> (with a determined effort to gouge tears out of his
eyes with his knuckles).&nbsp; &ldquo;Four times, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Governor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Four times! and so you&rsquo;ll
go on till you are sent away, I&rsquo;m afraid.&nbsp; Can you
read, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i> (with a penitential wriggle).&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
sir; I wish as I couldn&rsquo;t, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Governor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i> (with a doleful wag of his bullet-head).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cos then I shouldn&rsquo;t have read none of them
highwaymen&rsquo;s books, sir; it was them as was the beginning
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Governor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; (a pause)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you a mother, my lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boo-oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Governor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Answer me, my lad, have you a
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i> (convulsively clasping the corners of his collars,
and hiding his eyes in them).&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye-ye-ess,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Governor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, I thought so! where does she
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man-manchester, please, sir!&rdquo;
(a tremulous sniff, indicative of the impending explosion).</p>
<p><i>Governor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what do you think would be
her feelings could she see you as you now are?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boo-ooh&rdquo; (here a writhe so
agonized that a hand had to be spared from his eyes to save his
trousers from slipping down).&nbsp; &ldquo;Boo-ooh!&nbsp; I was
just a thinkin&rsquo; on her when you opened the cell, sir!&nbsp;
Boo-oo-ooh!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Governor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were thinking of your
mother, eh?&nbsp; <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>Well, well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that.&nbsp; If I let
you go back to your own cell, will you promise never to swear
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lad</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Booh! yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Governor</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may go, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a countenance almost radiant with his unexpected
stroke of good luck, the incorrigible young thief grasped his
trouser legs, and scuttled up the long dim corridor till, except
for his white tail, he was lost in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like the dark cell,&rdquo; remarked
the humane governor, as he gazed after the retreating figure;
&ldquo;anything rather than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The younger prisoners especially, I should say,&rdquo;
I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said the governor,
at the same time, however, shaking his head rather as a man who
<i>did</i> know, but did not care to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Regarding</span> the terms professional
thief and habitual criminal as synonymous, now that we come to
consider briefly what are at present the means adopted for the
reformation of criminals and the suppression and punishment of
crime, and what the most recent and plausible suggestions for
amendment and improvement, we find the work already done to our
hand, and naught remains but to cull from the shoals of evidence
<i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> that have been lately set before the
public.</p>
<p>The total cost of our prisons and prisoners for the year 1867,
was &pound;657,129, distributed as follows: (1) Extraordinary
charges for new buildings, &amp;c., &pound;177,553 19s. 9d.&nbsp;
(2) Ordinary charges &pound;108,218 15s. 11d.&nbsp; (3)
Officers&rsquo; salaries, &amp;c., &pound;213,285 15s. 5d., and
(4) Prisoners&rsquo; diet, sick allowances, clothing, &amp;c.,
&pound;158,071 5s. 3d.&nbsp; The average yearly charge per
prisoner under each head <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>of costs, was as follows:&mdash;(1)
Extraordinary charges &pound;9 17s. 4d.&nbsp; (2.) Ordinary
annual charges &pound;6 0s. 3d. (making together &pound;15 17s.
7d.).&nbsp; (3) Officers and attendants &pound;11 17s. 1d.&nbsp;
(4) Prisoners&rsquo; diet &pound;6 11s. 1d., and clothing
&pound;2 4s. 7d. (together &pound;8 15s. 8d.), making a total per
prisoner of &pound;36 10s. 4d., or omitting the extraordinary
charge for buildings, &amp;c., &pound;26 13s.&nbsp; The average
of &pound;36 10s. 4d. is higher than the corresponding average
for 1865&ndash;6 by &pound;2 1s. 8d.&nbsp; The average of
&pound;26 13s. is higher than the corresponding average by 15s.
1d.&nbsp; These averages are calculated upon the total amounts
under each head of expenditure, and the total daily average
number in all the prisons.&nbsp; The average cost per prisoner
naturally shows great variation in different prisons.&nbsp; The
highest is at Alnwick, viz.: &pound;114 3s. 2d. against
&pound;110 1s. 2d. in 1865&ndash;6, &pound;108 2s. 5d. in
1864&ndash;5, and &pound;88 15s. 11d. in 1863&ndash;4, <i>with a
daily average of one prisoner in each year</i>!&nbsp; At Oakham,
the average cost for 1866&ndash;7 is &pound;80 13s. 3d., with a
daily average of 10 prisoners against &pound;93 16s. 2d. in
1865&ndash;6, and &pound;87 1s. 9d. in 1864&ndash;5, with the
daily average of 8 prisoners in each of those years; at Appleby
&pound;70 2s. with a daily average of 6 prisoners; at Ilford
&pound;51 6s. with a daily average of 20 prisoners.&nbsp; The
lowest averages are as follows: At Hull &pound;16 17s., with a
daily average of 173 prisoners; at Salford &pound;16 17s. 8d.,
with a daily average of 568 prisoners; at Liverpool &pound;18 8s.
9d. with a daily average of 952 prisoners; at Devonport &pound;18
12s. 4d., with a daily average of 58 prisoners; at Durham
&pound;18 16s. 9d., with a daily average of 433 <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>prisoners;
and at Manchester &pound;19 1s. 3d., with a daily average of 631
prisoners.&nbsp; The following are the comparative costs per
prisoner for the whole of the prisons for each of the last six
years:&mdash;&pound;24 3s. 4d., &pound;23 7s. 5d., &pound;23 7s.
10d., &pound;24 3s. 3d., &pound;25 17s. 11d., and &pound;26
13s.</p>
<p>The total number of police and constabulary for the same year,
is set down at 24,073 as against 23,728 in the year
preceding.&nbsp; The total cost for the year is &pound;1,920,505
12s. 2d. as against &pound;1,827,105 16s. 7d. in 1866, an
increase of upwards of 5 per cent. following an increase of
&pound;78,647 17s. 1d., or 4.5 per cent. upon the amount for
1864&ndash;5.&nbsp; As compared with the total costs for
1856&ndash;7, the first year for which returns were made under
the Act; the increase in 1866&ndash;7 amounts to &pound;654,926,
or upwards of 51 per cent.&nbsp; The increase in the number of
the police and constabulary during the same period is 4,886, or
upwards of 25 per cent.</p>
<p>The number of persons committed for trial in 1867 was less
than the number for any of the four years immediately preceding
1866.&nbsp; The increase in 1867, as compared with 1866, is in
the number of males, viz., 328.&nbsp; In the number of females
there is a <i>decrease</i> of 206.&nbsp; The following are the
numbers committed for trial in each of the last 20
years:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>As
already intimated in these pages, Lord Kimberley is responsible
for introducing the broad and important subject of Criminal Law
Reform to the legislature for its reconsideration and
reformation.&nbsp; In introducing this bill for the suppression
of crime, his lordship reminded the peers assembled that in the
year 1853, after a very full discussion with respect to
transportation it was resolved, partly on account of the evils of
the system, and partly on account of the strong remonstrances of
our Australian colonists to whom our convicts had been sent, that
it should, to a considerable extent cease, and that accordingly
an Act was passed imposing for the first time the sentence of
penal servitude as a substitute for transportation in the greater
number of cases.&nbsp; From that time transportation was limited
to Western Australia and the Bermudas.&nbsp; The numbers sent to
Western Australia did not average more than 460 per annum.&nbsp;
The colonists, however, despite this moderate consignment, felt
by no means flattered by the distinction conferred on them, and
in consideration of their strong remonstrances, in the course of
a few years transportation to Australia entirely ceased.</p>
<p>Penal servitude was the arrangement substituted, and the chief
feature of it was the ticket-of-leave.&nbsp; The system promised
well, but no sooner was it fairly at work than the public took
alarm at the number of convicts scattered over the country
holding these tickets, and then another change was resolved
on.&nbsp; A commission, presided over by Lord Carnarvon, was
appointed to examine the whole question of penal servitude, and
the result was a <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>report containing several important
recommendations.&nbsp; Foremost of these was that sentences of
penal servitude which had been as short as three years, should
not, in future, be passed for shorter terms than seven
years.&nbsp; Another, almost equally important, was to the effect
that convicts sentenced to penal servitude should be subjected in
the first place to nine months separate imprisonment, and then to
labour on public works for the remainder of the term for which
they were sentenced, but with a power of earning by industry and
good conduct an abridgment of this part of punishment.&nbsp; The
provision under which police supervision has since been carried
out, and the conditions under which licences should be earned by
good conduct, were also laid down.&nbsp; As further stated by his
lordship, when the Act of 1864 was under consideration, great
doubts were expressed whether it was possible to carry out a
satisfactory system by which the good conduct of convicts and
their industry when employed on public works could be so measured
that they should earn an abridgment of their sentences.&nbsp;
Experience, however, showed that the system in its working was to
a great extent successful, especially when the management of the
business in question fell into the hands of Colonel Henderson,
who succeeded the late Sir Joshua Jebb.&nbsp; Under Colonel
Henderson&rsquo;s supervision it has been found possible to exact
from convicts the really hard and patient industry which is
necessary before they can obtain a remission of their
sentences.&nbsp; The value of the work performed by convicts at
the three convict prisons&mdash;Portsmouth, Portland, and
Chatham&mdash;<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>was during the year 1868, &pound;106,421; while the
cost of maintaining those establishments was &pound;110,532, so
that the earnings nearly equalled the whole expense to which the
country was put; indeed, as regards Chatham, where there are
great facilities for remunerative work in making bricks for
public works, there was an actual profit.&nbsp; In 1867 the
average daily number of convicts at Chatham was 990, and the
value of their labour was &pound;40,898 7s., while the cost of
their maintenance and supervision was &pound;35,315 18s., there
being thus a surplus of &pound;5,582 9s.&nbsp; Under this new and
improved system, in which the feature last quoted shows so
satisfactorily, crime decreased.&nbsp; In 1865&ndash;6 the
indictable offences committed numbered 50,549, and in
1866&ndash;7 they were 55,538, showing an increase of 4,989, or
something under 10 per cent.&nbsp; From 1856 to 1862, the
convictions excluding summary ones, the annual average was
13,859, while in 1867 the number was 14,207.&nbsp; His Lordship
explained that he began with 1856, because in the previous year
the Criminal Jurisdiction Act was passed, enabling a considerable
number of crimes to be dealt with summarily.&nbsp; Although this
shows an apparent increase from 13,859 to 14,207, it must be
remembered that in the interval the population increased by
nearly two and a-half millions, so that there is a decrease
rather than an increase in proportion to the population.&nbsp;
Satisfactory, however, as was this result, it appeared to Lord
Kimberley that, as we naturally obtain fresh experience from year
to year, fresh opportunities of committing crime being
discovered, and fresh means of meeting these offences, it is
necessary <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>from time to time to re-adjust our system, and make it
more complete.&nbsp; Another reason for carefully scrutinising,
and seeing whether we cannot improve our system, is the complete
cessation of transportation; for though during the last few years
we have not sent out to our colonics any very large number of
convicts, it is obvious that for 500 convicts a year to remain in
this country involves a considerable increase of the convict
population.&nbsp; The number of males now on licence is 1,566,
and of females 441, in 1870 it will probably be 1,705, and about
ten years hence it will probably be something under 3,000.</p>
<p>These, however, form but a small portion of the great criminal
class.&nbsp; Of this latter the average of 1865&ndash;6,
1864&ndash;5 and 1863&ndash;4, shows the following results:</p>
<p>Known thieves and depredators 22,959, receivers of stolen
goods 3,095, prostitutes 27,186, suspected persons 29,468,
vagrants and tramps 32,938, making a total of 122,646.&nbsp; In
the metropolis alone there were in 1866&ndash;7, 14,648 persons
living by dishonest means, and 5,628 prostitutes.&nbsp; The
number in 1865&ndash;6 being 14,491 and 5,554.</p>
<p>The above being in the main Lord Kimberley&rsquo;s grounds of
justification for bringing forward his &ldquo;Habitual
Criminals&rsquo; Bill,&rdquo; let us take its first provision,
that applying to convicts, who on the strength of a
ticket-of-leave are in the enjoyment of conditional liberty, and
inquire what is precisely the system it is intended to supersede,
and what are the practical results of the workings of this last
mentioned system, viz.: that which on the recommendation of the
committee, under the presidency <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>of Lord Carnavon, became law in
1864.&nbsp; The following memorandum as to the present system of
licence holders reporting themselves to the police, under the
Penal Servitude Amendment Act, 1864, was issued recently by
Colonel Henderson, Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A male licence holder is required
personally to report himself at the principal police-station of
the district in which he resides within three days of his
liberation.&nbsp; A printed descriptive form of the licence
holder is sent from the prison to the police with the address
where the man, previous to his liberation, stated he intended to
reside.&nbsp; The officer on duty, when the licence holder
reports himself, instructs him in what he is required to do, and
also delivers to him a printed notice.&nbsp; No further steps are
then taken by the police for a month from that date, when, if the
licence holder again reports himself, he is considered as
complying with the law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After inquiry to ascertain if the address given is a
correct one, no further supervision is kept over him by the
police, and his lodgings are not again visited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a licence holder neglects to report himself as
above, or is seen, or suspected of leading an irregular life,
then the police make quiet inquiry, and, as is frequently the
case, if it is found that he has left the address he was living
at, his description is inserted in the <i>Police Gazette</i> with
directions for apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The employers are never informed by the police that
they are employing a licence holder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Licence holders apprehended for offences have
complained <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>to the magistrates that the police harass them, but on
investigation such statements have always proved to be without
foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No case has ever been known of police levying black
mail on licence holders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Discharged Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society, 39,
Charing Cross, with the sanction of the Secretary of State,
undertakes the care of licence holders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The licence holders who wish to place themselves under
the care of this Society are required to report themselves, on
liberation, at the King Street Police Station, Westminster, where
they are served with a notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A messenger from Millbank Prison accompanies the
licence holders to the police-station, and after this form is
gone through, all local police supervision ceases until a report
is made from the Society to the Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of 368 male licence holders discharged into the
Metropolitan Police district in 1868, 290 placed themselves under
the care of the Discharged Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society, either
on discharge or subsequently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been difficulties in consequence of this
divided jurisdiction, but in the event of this bill passing, the
supervision of convicts who place themselves in charge of the
Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society, will be carried on by the police,
in conjunction with the officers of the Society, and can be so
arranged as to avoid any undue interference with the men; in
fact, it is quite as much the interest of the police to endeavour
to assist licence holders to get honest work, as to arrest them
if they misconduct themselves, <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>and for this purpose it would be
quite sufficient if the licence holder were bound by the
conditions of his licence to report change of residence and
employment, the monthly report being of no particular value, so
long as proper supervision is exercised by the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As regards the arrest of licence holders, or of persons
who have been twice convicted of felony, it is clear all must
depend on the personal knowledge of the police constable of the
person and antecedents of the suspected person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under ordinary circumstances, no constable interferes
with any licence holder, nor would he arrest any man on
suspicion, without previously reporting the circumstances to the
Commissioner, who would order quiet inquiry to be made, and give
instructions, if necessary, for the man&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Identification would be rendered more easy than at
present, by the proposed central registration.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the law at present stands, then, in the event of a ticket
of leave man failing to comply with the police regulations, and
on his being conveyed before a magistrate, it is provided that if
the magistrate is satisfied that he is not earning an honest
living, he may be committed to undergo his original term of
imprisonment.&nbsp; Under the restrictions of the proposed new
Bill, however, much more stringent arrangements are
suggested.&nbsp; The onus of proving his honesty will rest with
the man who holds the ticket.&nbsp; &ldquo;A licence holder may
at any time be summoned by a police constable before a
magistrate, and called upon to show that he is earning an honest
livelihood, the burden <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>of proof resting on him; if he
cannot prove his honesty, he may be committed to undergo his
original sentence of Penal Servitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it is evident on the face of it that the above quoted
clause of the proposed &ldquo;Habitual Criminals Bill&rdquo; is
beset by many grave objections.&nbsp; In the first place, to vest
such an amount of irresponsible power in the police is a step
hardly warranted by one&rsquo;s experience of the intelligence
and integrity of the &ldquo;force,&rdquo; satisfactory on the
whole as it may be.&nbsp; There can be no question that as a rule
the superintendents and inspectors and sergeants are in every
respect equal to the duties imposed on them; only for the
unenviable notoriety lately achieved by a functionary still
higher in command, commissioners also might have been included in
the favourable list.</p>
<p>It is equally true, too, that the great majority of the men of
the &ldquo;force&rdquo; discharge their duty with efficiency; at
the same time it is undeniable that there are exceptions to the
good rule.&nbsp; But too frequently do our criminal records
remind us that virtue&rsquo;s perfect armour is not invariably
represented by the helmet and the coat of blue.&nbsp; Only lately
there occurred an alarming instance of this.&nbsp; A gang of
plunderers and receivers of stolen goods was apprehended, and
presently there appeared on the scene an individual, then an
inspector of railway detective police, and formerly holding a
responsible position in the Metropolitan force, taking on
himself, with a coolness that bespoke his long experience, the
office of screening the thief and arranging his escape from the
law&rsquo;s righteous grasp.&nbsp; Richards is this
fellow&rsquo;s name, <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>and he was evidently well known to a
large circle of acquaintance, whose fame is recorded in the
records of the Old Bailey.&nbsp; With amazing audacity Mr.
Richards addressed himself to the two detective policemen who had
the case in hand, and offered them ten pounds each if they would
accommodate his clients by committing perjury when the day of
trial came.&nbsp; Happily the integrity of the two officers was
proof against the tempting bribe, and the unfortunate negotiator
found himself even deeper in the mire than those his
disinterested good nature would have aided.&nbsp; At the same
time one cannot refrain from asking, is this the first time that
Mr. Richards has evinced his obliging disposition, and the still
more important question, does he stand alone, or are there others
of his school?&nbsp; As is the case with all large communities,
the police force must include in its number men malicious,
prejudiced, wrong-headed and foolish.&nbsp; Probably there are no
serious grounds for the alarm that under the convenient cloak the
clause in question provides, the policeman, unscrupulous and
dishonest, might by levying black mail on the poor wretches so
completely in his power, reap a rich and iniquitous harvest, and
render nugatory one of the Bill&rsquo;s prime provisions.&nbsp;
This is an objection that carries no great weight.&nbsp; No law
that could be passed could put the criminal, the burglar, and the
house-breaker more at the mercy of the dishonest policeman than
he now is.&nbsp; As repeatedly appears in our criminal reports,
the sort of odd intimacy that commonly exists between the thief
and his natural enemy, the policeman, is very remarkable; the
latter is as well acquainted with <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>the haunts of the former as he is
with the abodes of his own friends and relatives.&nbsp; Should
the enemies meet in the street, the acquaintance is acknowledged
by a sort of confident
&ldquo;I-can-have-you-whenever-I-want-you&rdquo; look on the one
part, and a half devil-may-care, half deprecatory glance on the
other.&nbsp; When the crisis arrives, and the thief is
&ldquo;wanted,&rdquo; he is hailed as Jack, Tom, or Bill, and the
capture is effected in the most comfortable and business-like
manner imaginable.</p>
<p>Under such an harmonious condition of affairs, nothing could
be easier, were they both agreed, than bribery and corruption of
the most villanous sort, and, taking Colonel Henderson&rsquo;s
word, &ldquo;that no case has ever been known of police levying
black mail on licence holders,&rdquo; and further, considering
the inadequate pay the policeman receives for the amount of
intelligent and vigilant service required of him, the country may
be congratulated on possessing, on the whole, such an almost
unexceptionally good servant.</p>
<p>It is the wrong-headed policeman, probably, who would work the
greatest amount of mischief in this direction.&nbsp; The busy,
over-zealous man, neither malicious, dishonest, nor vindictive,
but simply a little too anxious to win for himself a character
for &ldquo;shrewdness and intelligence.&rdquo;&nbsp; This would
probably be the young policeman, desirous of making up for his
lack of experience by a display of extraordinary sagacity.&nbsp;
To such a man&rsquo;s home-bred, unofficially cultivated ideas of
right and wrong, it would appear of small use
&ldquo;suspecting&rdquo; an individual, unless he immediately set
about testing him with the utmost <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>severity to know the extent to which
the suspicion was justified.</p>
<p>To be sure, an attempt is made in the Bill, as it passed the
Lords, to guard against the weaknesses and shortcomings of
constables by making it incumbent on them to obtain the written
authority of a superior before they arrest and take a man before
a magistrate; but really this may mean just nothing at all.&nbsp;
It may be assumed that all the evidence a director of police
would require before he granted a written authority, would be the
declaration of the policeman applying for it that he had fair
grounds for making the application.&nbsp; Undoubtedly he would be
expected to make out a good case; but that, as an over-zealous
and prejudiced man, he would be sure to do.&nbsp; The
superintendent, or whoever it was that had power to issue a
written warrant for a &ldquo;suspect&rsquo;s&rdquo; apprehension,
could not, by examination of the prisoner, convince himself of
the justice of the act of his subordinate, to do which would be
to usurp the magisterial office.&nbsp; And the process would
probably be attended with this disadvantage,&mdash;that the said
written order for arrest would wear an importance that really did
not belong to it.&nbsp; If a man were arrested simply on the
authority of a common policeman, the chances are that the
magistrate would scrutinise the case narrowly, and be guided to a
conviction solely by the evidence and his own discretion; but the
case would come under the new act before him to a large extent
prejudiced.&nbsp; He is instructed that the warrant that
legalised the man&rsquo;s apprehension was not issued in <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>vague
supposition that it might he justifiable: an official of the
law&mdash;a man high in authority&mdash;has sanctioned the
arrest, and here is his written testimony that he considered the
step expedient.</p>
<p>Again, let us for a moment contemplate the difficulties that
must always attend the proving of his honesty by a man who,
according to the high authority of the Lord Chancellor, has
&ldquo;no character to lose.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As to what was
said about the injury done to a man&rsquo;s character by
supervision, he must observe that a man&rsquo;s character was
gone after two convictions.&nbsp; It was idle to say that after
two convictions a man had a character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the case of a man against whom nothing criminal was ever
suspected, it might be easy enough for him to prove his honesty
any day, or any hour of the day, he might be called on to do so;
but it is altogether different with the individual who dare not
even lay claim to a character for honesty, to prove that the
suspicions entertained against him are unfounded.&nbsp; It should
be borne in mind that the difficulties of the poor wretch&rsquo;s
condition almost preclude the possibility of his making a show of
earning his bread in a worthy manner.&nbsp; In the majority of
cases he will be found to be a man without a trade, or, if he has
one, he will probably sink it, and endeavour to keep out of sight
of all who knew him and the story of his downfall, by hiding
amongst the great multitude who turn their hands to any
rough-and-ready labour that will bring them a shilling.&nbsp;
There are hundreds and thousands of men in <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>London, and
indeed in all great cities, who &ldquo;pick up&rdquo; a living
somehow&mdash;anyhow, and who, though they all the time are
honest fellows, would find it difficult to account for, and bring
forward evidence to show, how they were engaged last Monday, and
again on Wednesday, and what they earned, and whom they earned it
of.&nbsp; Such men &ldquo;job about,&rdquo; very often in
localities that, in the case of a man under police supervision,
to be seen there would be to rouse suspicions as to his
intentions.&nbsp; For instance, many a shilling or sixpence is
&ldquo;picked up&rdquo; by men who have nothing better to do, by
hanging about railway stations and steamboat wharves, and looking
out for passengers who have luggage they wish carried.&nbsp; But
supposing that a man, a &ldquo;ticket-of-leave,&rdquo; was to
resort to such a means of obtaining a livelihood, and that he was
seen &ldquo;hanging about&rdquo; such places day after day by a
watchful detective who knew who and what he was,&mdash;with what
amount of credulity would the authorities receive his statement
that he was &ldquo;looking out for a chance to carry
somebody&rsquo;s trunk or carpetbag&rdquo;!&nbsp; In all
probability the na&iuml;ve assertion would provoke a smile on the
face of the magistrate who heard the case, and there would be
&ldquo;laughter&rdquo; in court.</p>
<p>Again, as is well known, hundreds of men seek work at the
docks.&nbsp; It might be supposed by their innocent lordships
that nothing could be easier than for a man to prove his
employment at such gigantic and sternly-regulated establishments
as the London or St. Katherine Docks, with their staff of
liveried officials and responsible gate-keepers.&nbsp; The
dock-labourer, on his <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>admittance, is furnished with a
ticket, and when he leaves he is searched so as to make sure that
he has stolen none of the valuable goods scattered in every
direction.&nbsp; But it is a fact that no system can be looser or
more shambling or shabbier than that which rules in the drudgery
departments of these great emporiums for ship-loading and
warehousing.&nbsp; Every morning the dock-gates are besieged by a
mob clamorous as that which in the old time swarmed about the
door of the casual-ward; and if rags and patches and
hunger-pinched visages go for anything, the quality of both mobs
is much of a sort.&nbsp; It is only men who can find nothing else
to do who apply at the docks for work, for the pay is but
threepence an hour, and the labour, hoisting-out and landing
goods from the holds of ships, is cruelly hard; and it is not
uncommon to employ a man for an hour and a half or two hours, and
then discharge him.&nbsp; But it is better than nothing, and it
is the &ldquo;ready penny&rdquo;&mdash;emphatically the
penny&mdash;that the miserable, shamefaced, twice-convicted man,
with some remnant of conscience and good intent remaining in him,
would seek as the last resource of desperate honesty, all other
sources failing him.&nbsp; But it would be next to impossible for
him to prove that he had been working at the docks; no one knows
him there.&nbsp; He might be there employed twenty times, and
each time in a different gang, and under a different
ganger.&nbsp; His workmates for the time are strangers, bearing
not names, but numbers.&nbsp; Were it to save his life, he would
find it hard to prove that he occasionally found a
&ldquo;job&rdquo; at the <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>docks, and, despite all his honest
exertions, he would he liable to have his ticket revoked, and be
sent back to finish to its full length his original sentence.</p>
<p>Again, it might even happen that a suspected man able to prove
his honesty would find himself almost in as complete a fix as the
one who, through circumstances over which he had no control, was
unable to do so.&nbsp; Under the existing system, we have Colonel
Henderson&rsquo;s word for it, masters are never informed by the
police that they are employing a license-holder; but he would
cease to be assured this immense advantage if Lord Kimberley has
his way with him.&nbsp; As Earl Shaftesbury pertinently remarks:
&ldquo;A holder of the ticket-of-leave goes before a magistrate;
and what happens?&nbsp; He proves that he is earning an honest
livelihood, and the magistrate dismisses him.&nbsp; He returns to
his work, and his employer dismisses him also.&nbsp; It has
occurred before now that men have been dismissed by their
employers under somewhat similar circumstances.&nbsp; How can you
compensate a man for such a loss as that?&nbsp; You cannot do it;
and yet you expose men who may be earning an honest livelihood to
the danger of that happening to them if they refuse a demand for
hush-money, or in any other way give offence to a dishonest
police-constable.&nbsp; I know at the present moment a young man
who, though convicted, is now in respectable employment, and in
the receipt of good wages.&nbsp; He is living in terror, lest,
under the circumstances to which I have referred, he may be
brought before a police-magistrate.&nbsp; Depend on it that
hundreds <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>of men in that position are now watching the progress
of this Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the authority of the late Sir Richard Mayne it has
been stated that the police have, through the clause that insists
on convicts reporting themselves monthly, been enabled to furnish
employment to a good many of the ticket-of-leave men; this,
however, is very doubtful.&nbsp; That some situations may have
been obtained for these men through the exertions of the police
and the Discharged Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society may be true; but
of this I am certain, that whatever returns the police may make
of the places they have obtained for released convicts, they have
not obtained anything like the number that those men obtained for
themselves before the adoption of so stringent a
provision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is undoubtedly a depth of criminality to which it is
possible for a man to descend, putting himself utterly beyond
reach of anything but human compassion.&nbsp; His conversion is
quite hopeless, and he is no better than a predatory wild-beast,
whose ferocity will endure just as long as his brute-strength
remains; he would probably bite his best friend at his dying
gasp.&nbsp; The sort of ruffian here alluded to will perhaps be
better understood by aid of the following illustration,
&ldquo;drawn from life&rdquo; not many months since.&nbsp; It is
a case of a ruffian committed for trial for
&ldquo;garotting&rdquo; and nearly murdering a gentleman.&nbsp;
The delectable epistle was written by garotter &ldquo;Bill&rdquo;
to his brother; and was intrusted to a prisoner, who had served
his time and was about to quit the gaol, for hand-delivery.&nbsp;
<a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>Either
out of fear or forgetfulness, however, the letter was left behind
and discovered by the authorities.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dundee Prison, July 18th, 1868.&mdash;Dear
Brother, the only thing I am afraid of is that moll; if you can
manage to square her I fear nothing; but if she swears she saw me
have him by the throat it will not go well with me, for they are
most d&mdash;d down on garotting.&nbsp; Then again, if she says
she saw him with that amount of money, by &mdash;! they might put
me in for the robbery too; and there is seven years dead
certain.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what a b&mdash; like that
will say.&nbsp; It can surely to God be squared between so many
of you, and only the moll to come against me.&nbsp; If the bloke
is in town he could be easily squared, I think; you could get him
sweet, put the gloves on him, and things like that, and get him
to say he cannot swear to me in court; that would be all that was
wanted; or it is very easy giving that moll a dose.&nbsp; Put
Ginger up to it; who the h&mdash; would take notice of a w&mdash;
kicking the bucket?&nbsp; I would do it for you.&nbsp; If any of
them is squared, tell Ginger to just sign M. H. at the bottom of
her letter, so as I may know.&nbsp; I think it would be a good
idea for my mother to get the bloke privately, and make an appeal
to him; he would have a little feeling for her, I think; if you
was getting him into the Garrick the wifey could talk to him so
fine.&nbsp; If you only had one of them squared that&rsquo;s all
that is wanted; for I am certain there is no more against me than
them two.&nbsp; Set your brains to work, and stick at nothing; <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>tell them
not to be afraid of perjury in this case; they can&rsquo;t be
brought in for it nohow; swear black is white; I must get off if
they do the right thing; swear to anything; swear the b&mdash;
wigs off their heads; there is no danger of being brought in for
perjury in this case, not a d&mdash;d bit.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Bill</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the head of the letter the following was written across the
page:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Poison the moll if she will not do
what&rsquo;s right; by C&mdash;! I would think d&mdash;d little
of doing it to save my brother!&nbsp; Ginger will fix her if you
tell her to.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following was written inside the envelope of the
letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They must not forget about me having a sore
hand; that might help me too, as it would not be very likely I
could seize him by the throat and compress the same, as it is
stated in my indictment.&nbsp; That will be a good point, I
think, he being a stout man.&nbsp; Tell them to be sure and stick
to not seeing the bloke, and that I slept in the house that
night; not likely that I could hold him with one hand; they can
swear that my right hand was very sore, not fit to be used
anyhow, as it was, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It came out in the course of the evidence that the meaning of
the word &ldquo;bloke&rdquo; was &ldquo;a man whom a woman might
pick up in the street;&rdquo; that &ldquo;moll&rdquo; was the
name for a woman; and that &ldquo;Ginger&rdquo; was a nickname
for one of the female witnesses.</p>
<p>To ruffians of this school, if to any, applies Lord
Carnarvon&rsquo;s terrible suggestion of imprisonment for life,
without hope, or possibility even, of release.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is idle to say that the subject of so
many convictions <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>is not absolutely and hopelessly hardened: they belong
to a class of persons on whom punishment is only wasted, and the
only thing is to shut them up for the rest of their lives, and
keep them out of the possibility of doing any harm to
society.&nbsp; I believe that such a course is best for them and
for society, and that no objection to it can be reasonably
urged.&nbsp; The convict-establishments of this country are
already paying their way, and the surplus cost is very light; on
the other hand, if you look at the cost which a criminal puts the
State to in his detection, trial, and other criminal proceedings,
it is perfectly clear that the cheapest course for the country
would be to shut him up.&nbsp; As far as the man himself is
concerned it is also the most humane and the kindest
course.&nbsp; He exchanges a most miserable state of life outside
the prison-walls, for one of comparative cleanliness and order
inside.&nbsp; And if you calculate the time which such a man has
spent in prison&mdash;broken only by the shorter intervals during
which he has been let loose and again recaptured&mdash;it will be
found that the difference between the period actually spent in
prison and a lifelong sentence would really be very slight in
amount.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As need not be mentioned, however, habitual criminals of the
type above quoted are by far the exception, and not the
rule.&nbsp; Experience teaches us that to become a
ticket-of-leave man is not invariably to be converted from a
human creature to a callous brute,&mdash;blind and deaf in vice,
and doggedly determined so to continue to the last; give him a
fair chance to amend, and <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>in very many cases he will embrace
it, thankfully even.&nbsp; The statistics of the Prisoners&rsquo;
Aid Society encourage us to hope better of even the worst of the
criminal class.&nbsp; As has already been shown, the convicts
themselves recognise and gratefully appreciate the advantages
held out to them by the humanitarians whose head-quarters are by
Charing Cross.&nbsp; Of 368 male convicts discharged in one year,
only 78 neglected to make application for the bounty.&nbsp; It
appears from the Society&rsquo;s most recent return that the
total number of discharged prisoners assisted by the association
since May 1857 was 5,798, but the average number had recently
decreased, because fewer prisoners had of late been released on
license.&nbsp; The number of those who had applied to the Society
during the first six months of last year (1868) was 145, of whom
26 had emigrated; 44 had found good and constant employment in
the metropolis; 15 had gone to sea; 25 had been sent to places
beyond the Metropolitan Police-district, and placed under the
supervision of the local police, and 35 had been classed as
unsatisfactory and bad: but these included all those who were
known to be in honest employment, but were so classed because
they failed to report themselves to the police, as required by
the Act.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the Commons will give
countenance to the new and severe measures sought by the Lords to
be adopted against the convicted man at liberty under
ticket-license.&nbsp; One thing is certain, it would be better to
do away altogether with <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>tickets-of-leave than use them as
stumbling-blocks to a man&rsquo;s reformation.&nbsp; The only
object of a ticket-of-leave is to give the holder a chance of
returning to honest courses some months earlier than, under the
rigid term of his sentence, he would be enabled to.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly it is necessary to guard against, as far as possible,
an abuse of the privilege.&nbsp; Full and sufficient opportunity
should be allowed a man to follow honest pursuits, if he be so
inclined; but it is only fair that the authorities should reserve
to themselves the power of holding him in tether, so to say, so
as to be able to haul him back to fast anchorage, should his
ill-behaviour make such a step desirable; but meanwhile the
tether-line should run slack and free&mdash;it should by no means
be wound about a man&rsquo;s hands so as to impede his honest use
of them, or about his neck so as to strangle him.&nbsp; At
Wakefield we are informed there is an organisation by which every
prisoner on his discharge&mdash;whether on a ticket-of-leave or
otherwise&mdash;could find a home for six or twelve months, till
he is able to find employment for himself, or till an employer
came to look for him.&nbsp; Eighty per cent of the persons
attached to the Wakefield establishment had engaged in, and
settled down to, honest employment.&nbsp; Surely such a result
should encourage those in authority to found similar institutions
in other parts of the country.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To return, however, to the projected Habitual Criminals&rsquo;
Bill.&nbsp; It is not the ticket-of-leave man alone who has
reasons for quaking lest it should become law; quaking <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>for fear of
injustice, not justice, that is to say.&nbsp; The class its stern
provisions chiefly, and, as I venture to opine, cruelly affect
are those unfortunates who have suffered two distinct terms of
imprisonment.&nbsp; From the date of his second conviction a man
is to be subject to police supervision for a term of seven
years.&nbsp; They have the advantage over the ticket-of-leave
man, that they are not required to report themselves periodically
at a police-station; but, like the criminal of deeper dye, any
day within their seven years of supervision they are liable to be
arrested by the police and taken before a magistrate, to prove
that they are not deriving a livelihood from dishonest
sources.&nbsp; Should they fail in doing so, they are to be
committed to prison for a year.&nbsp; Of the question itself,
&ldquo;What is an habitual criminal?&rdquo; remarks the
<i>Times</i>, commenting on the communication of its
correspondent, &ldquo;we say, take a walk with the police, and
they will show you the class in all its varieties as easily as
you could be shown the animals in the Zoological Gardens.&nbsp;
Here they are,&mdash;men about whose character and calling nobody
would ever pretend to entertain a doubt.&nbsp; We have been all
perplexing ourselves with the possible fate of some contrite
convict disposed to become respectable, but thwarted in his
efforts by the intervention of the police.&nbsp; Why, among the
real genuine representatives of crime&mdash;among the people
described by our correspondent&mdash;there is not a man who
dreams, or ever would dream, of any honest calling . . .&nbsp;
The profession has its grades, like any other; and so here <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>is a
company of first-class thieves, and another company representing
the opposite end of the scale.&nbsp; At one establishment they
are fashionably attired, and not altogether ill-mannered; at
another the type is that of Bill Sykes himself, even to his
bulldog.&nbsp; But through all these descriptions, whether of
house or inmate, host or guest, high or low, thief or receiver,
there runs one assumption which we press upon our readers as
practically decisive of the question before us.&nbsp; It is this:
that about &lsquo;the habitual criminality&rsquo; of the whole
class there is not, in the mind of any human creature concerned,
the smallest doubt whatever. . . .&nbsp; The practice of the past
generation was simple: some petty offence commonly began, then as
now, a criminal career.&nbsp; It was detected and punished, and
the criminal was sent back to his place in society.&nbsp; A
second, and perhaps a third, act of deeper guilt followed, and
the graduate in crime was condemned to transportation beyond
seas.&nbsp; As long as this punishment retained any terrors it
may have been efficient; but long before it was abandoned it had
come to be recognised as an acknowledged benefit rather than a
penalty by those who were sentenced to it.&nbsp; The result was
the constant secretion of a criminal class on one hand, and the
removal on the other to another sphere when they became ripe for
the voyage&mdash;the removal being viewed as an encouragement to
the commission of similar offences.&nbsp; We must make the
painful acknowledgment that part of this dismal cycle cannot be
materially altered.&nbsp; When a man is convicted of his first
criminal act, we cannot <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>know whether it is an isolated deed
or whether it is the first-fruit of a lifetime.&nbsp; When he has
gone from less to greater, and has proved himself indurated in
crime, we are forced to protect society by removing him from it.
. . .&nbsp; Nor does the proposal involve that extensive and
minute system of police <i>espionage</i> of which some people
have been apprehensive.&nbsp; An honest man can always keep out
of such questionable circumstances; and unless he places himself
within them, he is as independent of the police as any
unconvicted Englishman.&nbsp; When a man has been twice
convicted, it is surely no great hardship to deprive him of the
privilege of attempting and plotting crime with
impunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Were</span> it not that the reader&rsquo;s
sound and simple sense renders it quite unnecessary, it might be
of importance to premise that to be &ldquo;only a beggar&rdquo;
does not constitute a human being a curse against his
species.&nbsp; There are those amongst the greatest and most
famous who have been beggars, and many of the mightiest, groaning
under the crushing burden of distracting power and unruly riches,
have bemoaned their fate and envied the careless beggar whose
dwindled strength was at least equal to carrying his slender
wallet, whose heart was as light as his stomach, and whose
wildest dreams of wealth never soared vastly above a cosy barn to
sleep in, a warm old cast-off coat, and a sixpence.&nbsp; To be
sure, in many instances these dissatisfied ones <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>may not
have given any steadfast consideration as regards such a decided
change of state as might happen to suit them.&nbsp; It is related
of a King of Scotland that, wearying of the cares of government,
he slipped away from his palace and its cloying luxuries, to
taste the delights that attach to the existence of ragged roving
mendicants; but though his majesty affected to have enjoyed
himself very much, and discoursed afterwards gravely of the great
moral profit it brought him, it is not recorded that he
persevered for any very long time in the pursuit of the
newly-discovered blessing, or that he evinced any violent longing
to return to it.&nbsp; Perhaps, having convinced himself of the
advantages of poverty, he generously resolved to leave it to his
subjects, contenting himself with such occasional glimpses of it
as might be got by looking out o&rsquo; window.</p>
<p>It is now 333 years ago since the beggar ceased to be
dependent on voluntary charity, and the State insisted on his
support by the parishes.&nbsp; In the year 1536 was passed an Act
of Parliament abolishing the mendicant&rsquo;s right to solicit
public alms.&nbsp; Under a penalty of twenty shillings a month
for every case of default, the parochial authorities were bound
to provide work for the able-bodied.&nbsp; A poor&rsquo;s-rate,
as we now understand the term, was not then thought of, the money
required for pauper relief being chiefly derived from collections
in the churches, a system that to a limited extent enabled the
clergy to exercise their pious influences as in the old times,
and before the destruction of monasteries and religious houses by
Henry VIII.&nbsp; It was the <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>wholesale spoliation in question,
that occurred immediately after the Reformation, that first made
known to the people at large the vast numbers of beggars that
were amongst them.&nbsp; The Act of 27 Henry VIII. c. 25,
prohibited indiscriminate almsgiving.</p>
<p>What the charitable townsman had to give, he was bound to
distribute within the boundaries of the parish in which he
resided.&nbsp; Under the old and looser condition of affairs the
beggar derived the greater part of his gettings from the
traveller; but the obnoxious Act effectually cut off from him
this fruitful source of supply, since it provided that any
parishioner or townsman who distributed alms out of his proper
district, should forfeit to the State ten times the amount
given.&nbsp; Whether the recipient of the bounty was in a
position to act as &ldquo;informer,&rdquo; with the customary
advantage of receiving half the penalty, is not stated.</p>
<p>Against sturdy beggars the law was especially severe.&nbsp; On
his first conviction he was whipped, the second led to the
slicing-off of his right ear, and if after that he was deaf to
the law&rsquo;s tender admonitions, sentence of death was
executed on him.</p>
<p>This savage law, however, remained in force not more than ten
years; one of the earliest Acts of Edward VI. was to mitigate the
penalties attaching to beggary.&nbsp; Even under this humane
King&rsquo;s ruling, however, a beggar&rsquo;s punishment was
something very far beyond a joke.&nbsp; Every person able to
work, and not willing, and declining a &ldquo;job,&rdquo; though
for no more tempting wages than his bare meat and drink, was <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>liable to
be branded on the shoulder, and any man willing to undertake the
troublesome charge might claim the man as his slave for two
years.&nbsp; His scale of diet during that time was more meagre
than that allotted to the pauper in our own times.&nbsp; If the
slave&rsquo;s master was a generous man, he might bestow on him
the scraps from his table, or such meat-offal as his dogs had no
relish for; but in law he was only bound to provide him with a
sufficiency of bread and water.&nbsp; If such hot feeding did not
provoke him to arouse and set to work with a will, his master
might chain him and flog him to death&rsquo;s door; and so long
as he did not drive him beyond that, the law would hold him
harmless.&nbsp; Sometimes the poor wretch so goaded would run
away, but in the event of his being recaptured, he was branded on
the cheek, and condemned to lifelong servitude; and if this did
not cure his propensity for &ldquo;skedaddling,&rdquo; he was
hanged offhand.&nbsp; Any employer having a fancy for such a
commodity as an incorrigible runaway might have the man so
condemned as his slave for life; but if no one offered, he was
chained at the legs and set to work to keep the highways in
repair.</p>
<p>It was speedily found, however, that under such mild laws it
was impossible to keep the begging fraternity in a proper frame
of mind; and after a trial of it for three years the old Act of
Henry was restored in full force.</p>
<p>In 1551 there dawned symptoms of the system that has taken
more than three hundred years to develop, and even now can
scarcely lay claim to perfection.&nbsp; Collectors <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>were
appointed whose duty it was to make record of the name,
residence, and occupation of all who apparently were able to
give, as well as of those whose helpless distress entitled them
to relief.&nbsp; In the words of the ancient enactment, the said
collectors were to &ldquo;gently ask every man and woman, that
they of their charity will give weekly to the relief of the
poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; To give, however, was optional, and not
compulsory; no more severe pressure was brought to bear against a
grudger than that the minister or churchwardens were sent to him
to exhort him to charity; but so many curmudgeons remained
inexorable that the voluntary system remained in force no longer
than twelve years; and then the statute regulating poor&rsquo;s
relief was remodelled, and it was declared good law that any
person able to contribute, and declining to do so, might be
summoned before a justice, who would tax him according to his
discretion, and commit him to gaol if he still remained
obdurate.</p>
<p>This last Act was passed in 1563, but nine years afterwards,
we find the Government once again urged to repair what evidently
had all this time remained an unsatisfactory business.&nbsp; It
is evident that the arrangements made for the support of the
impotent poor tended to loosen the shackles invented for the
suppression of the professional beggar.&nbsp; The last-mentioned
individual was found to be flourishing again, and it was deemed
advisable to make still shorter his restricted tether.&nbsp; A
law was passed enacting that &ldquo;all persons whole and mighty
in body, able to labour, not having <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>land or master, nor using any lawful
merchandise, craft, or mystery, and all common labourers, able in
body, loitering and refusing to work for such reasonable wage as
is commonly given, should for the first offence be grievously
whipped, and burned through the gristle of the right ear with a
hot iron of the compass of an inch about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mild and moderate mandate was promulgated under the
sanction of the virgin Queen Elizabeth, and it is to be observed
that during the same beneficent reign were passed laws in
connection with labour and labourers that, were they revived,
would go hard with trade-unionists and strikers in general.&nbsp;
By the statutes 39 of Elizabeth, cap. 3 and 4 (1598), to refuse
to work at the recognised and ordinary wages subjected the
malcontent to be &ldquo;openly whipped until his body should be
bloody, and forthwith sent from parish to parish, the most
straight way to the parish where he was born, there to put
himself to labour, as a true subject ought to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Under the same Acts of Elizabeth, the overseers of the poor in
every parish were empowered to raise by &ldquo;taxation of every
inhabitant, parson, vicar, and other, and of every occupier of
lands, houses, tithes, mines, &amp;c., such sums of money as they
shall require for providing a sufficient stock of flax, hemp,
wool, and other ware or stuff to set the poor on work, and also
competent sums for relief of lame, blind, old, and impotent
persons.&rdquo;&nbsp; By virtue of the Acts in question, justices
were empowered to commit to prison the able-bodied who would not
work; and churchwardens <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>and overseers were charged to build
suitable houses, at the cost of the parish, for the reception of
the impotent poor only.</p>
<p>As, however, is observed by Mr. Halliday (to whose excellent
account of the <i>Origin and History of the Poor-Laws</i> I stand
indebted for much of the material employed in this summary)
&ldquo;these simple provisions were in course of time greatly
perverted, and many abuses were introduced into the
administration of the poor-law.&nbsp; One of the most mischievous
practices was that which was established by the justices for the
county of Berks in 1795, when, in order to meet the wants of the
labouring population&mdash;caused by the high price of
provisions&mdash;an allowance in proportion to the number of his
family was made out of the parish fund to every labourer who
applied for relief.&nbsp; This allowance fluctuated with the
price of the gallon loaf of second flour, and the scale was so
adjusted as to return to each family the sum which in a given
number of loaves would cost beyond the price, in years of
ordinary abundance.&nbsp; This plan was conceived in a spirit of
benevolence, but the readiness with which it was adopted in all
parts of England clearly shows the want of sound views on the
subject.&nbsp; Under the allowance-system the labourer received a
part of his means of subsistence in the form of a parish-gift,
and as the fund out of which it was provided was raised from the
contributions of those who did not employ labourers as well as of
those who did, their employers, being able in part to burden
others with the payment for their labour, had a direct interest
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>in
perpetuating the system.&nbsp; Those who employed labourers
looked upon the parish contribution as part of the fund out of
which they were to be paid, and accordingly lowered their rate of
wages.&nbsp; The labourers also looked on the fund as a source of
wage.&nbsp; The consequence was, that the labourer looked to the
parish, and as a matter of right, without any regard to his real
wants; and he received the wages of his labour as only one and a
secondary source of the means of subsistence.&nbsp; His character
as a labourer became of less value, his value as a labourer being
thus diminished under the combined operation of these two
causes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the olden time, as at present, it appears that the Irish
figured conspicuously in the ranks of beggary.&nbsp; As is shown
by the recent returns, there are haunting the metropolis nearly
three mendicants hailing from the Emerald Isle to one of any
other nation; and that it was so so long ago as the reign of King
Charles II. the following proclamation will sufficiently
attest:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Proclamation for the speedy rendering
away of Irishe Beggars out of this Kingdome into their owne
Countrie and for the Suppressing and Ordering of Rogues and
Vagabonds according to the Laws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas this realme hath of late been pestered with
great numbers of Irishe beggars who live here idly and
dangerously, and are of ill example to the natives of this
Kingdome; and whereas the multitude of English rogues and
vagabonds doe much more abound than in former tymes&mdash;some
wandering and begging under the colour of soldiers and mariners,
<a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>others
under the pretext of impotent persons, whereby they become a
burden to the good people of the land&mdash;all which happeneth
by the neglect of the due execution of the lawes formerly with
great providence made for relief of the true poor and indigent
and for the punishment of sturdy rogues and vagabonds: for the
reforming thereof soe great a mischiefe, and to prevent the many
dangers which will ensue by the neglect thereof; the King, by the
advice of his Privy Council and of his judges, commands that all
the laws and statutes now in force for the punishment of rogues
and vagabonds be duly putt in execution; and more particularly
that all Irishe beggars which now are in any part of this
Kingdome, wandering or begging under what pretence soever, shall
forthwith depart this realme and return to their owne countries
and there abide.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authorities of Cumberland and Westmoreland appear to have
hit on an expedient that has proved successful in diminishing the
number of tramps that formerly infested those counties.&nbsp; A
recently published report states: &ldquo;In consequence of
frequent and general complaints from the people of these two
counties, as to the numerous robberies committed by tramping
vagrants, it was determined, at the end of the year 1867, to
enforce the Vagrant Act strictly.&nbsp; The result has been that,
in the year ending at Michaelmas 1868, 524 persons were
apprehended in the two counties for begging from house to house,
and 374 of them were committed to prison.&nbsp; The effect has
been, to a certain extent, like that which occurred in the time
of the cattle-plague; when the <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>police told the tramps at the
frontier that they must either stop or must be disinfected, and
they turned hack.&nbsp; The daily average number of tramps and
vagrants in the two counties in the year ending at Michaelmas
1868 was only 150, making a total decrease of 6935 in the year;
and various petty larcenies, burglaries, and other crimes
decreased remarkably.&nbsp; The chief constable has reported that
the course adopted has been attended with most beneficial
results, in checking professional mendicancy and preventing
crime; and he is persuaded that if the law were generally and
uniformly carried into effect, tramping vagrancy, as a trade,
would be very soon put an end to.&nbsp; He says that, as a rule,
the condition of the hands will enable the police to judge
between the professional tramp and the working man really
travelling in search of work, and that all difficulty might be
removed by requiring the latter to procure a certificate from the
head of the police of the starting-place, which would protect him
against apprehension, and which might also guarantee certain
relief at appointed places along his route.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Effect of</i> &ldquo;<i>The Society for
the Suppression of Mendicity</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<i>State Business
carried out by Individual Enterprise</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The
Discharged Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
quiet Work of these Societies</i>&mdash;<i>Their Mode of
Work</i>&mdash;<i>Curious Statistics</i>&mdash;<i>Singular
Oscillations</i>&mdash;<i>Diabolical Swindling</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Society for the Suppression of
Mendicity has done more towards checking imposture, and bringing
evildoers to punishment, than the Government itself,
notwithstanding all the elaborate and expensive machinery at its
command.&nbsp; Nor, by the way, is this a solitary instance of
business peculiarly its own being shirked by the State, and
handed over to be dealt with by the skill, energy, and
perseverance of a few private individuals.&nbsp; A kindred
association to that, the province of which is the better
government of the beggars of London, is that which devotes its
energies to the reclamation of returned convicts.&nbsp; Anyone at
all acquainted with the matter is aware of the immense amount of
lasting and substantial good that the &ldquo;Discharged
Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society&rdquo; has accomplished.&nbsp; That
the <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>individuals chiefly concerned&mdash;the returned
convicts themselves&mdash;fully appreciate the advantages held
out by the said Society is sufficiently proved by the fact, that
out of 368 licence-holders discharged into the metropolis, 290
placed themselves in its hands.&nbsp; No doubt such arrangements
do prove as convenient as economical as regards the Government;
but whether it is just to inflict a responsibility of such
magnitude on private individuals is another question; or whether
the easement it confers is cheaply purchased by our rulers at the
cost of so unmistakable a confession of their incapacity.</p>
<p>So quietly and unobtrusively do these self-constituted
guardians of public morality perform the arduous duties they
undertake, that it may be safely assumed not one person in a
thousand is aware what their prime objects are, let alone the
means by which they are accomplished.&nbsp; As regards the
Mendicity Society, there can be no doubt what is the popular
impression.&nbsp; It is commonly regarded as a sort of amateur
detective association for the discovery of fraudulent
begging,&mdash;a Society that has in its employ certain cunning
individuals of the detested breed of &ldquo;spies,&rdquo; who
earn their wages by lurking in shady places, and peeping over
men&rsquo;s shoulders, and covertly listening to their private
conversation.&nbsp; The full extent of the Society&rsquo;s
usefulness, according to vulgar prejudice, is represented by the
unfortunate &ldquo;cadger&rdquo; pounced on in the act of
receiving alms, and carried before a magistrate to account for
that enormous iniquity.&nbsp; People, however, <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>who know no
more of the Society than this, know only of the smallest and
least important of its functions.&nbsp; It is a
poor&rsquo;s-relief association on an extensive scale.&nbsp; It
has its labour-sheds for testing the genuineness of the
mendicants that apply at the office, to say nothing of a real
treadmill of its own.&nbsp; Moreover it proclaims its ability to
offer suitable employment to <i>every</i> able-bodied mendicant
referred to it.&nbsp; The following is the Society&rsquo;s method
of dealing.&nbsp; The plan of the institution is to provide
subscribers with tickets, which are intended to be distributed to
street-beggars only, and which will insure admission to the
Society&rsquo;s office, where the applicant is examined by the
sitting or assistant manager, who directs such immediate relief
as in his judgment may appear proper.</p>
<p>If the applicant appears deserving, and is without lodging,
money sufficient to procure one for the night is given.&nbsp; In
cases where the applicant appears to have an immediate claim on
any London parish, the pauper is referred to the overseers of
such parish.&nbsp; If, as in some cases, it is requisite for the
applicant to return on a subsequent day, he is furnished with a
return-ticket, which introduces him again to the office for
further relief.&nbsp; In the mean time inquiry is made, if
practicable, into the character of the pauper, by which the
sitting manager is governed in awarding proper relief.&nbsp; Men
are sent to the Society&rsquo;s premises to chop wood, and women
and children to the oakum-room.&nbsp; During the time they are
employed, men receive eightpence, and women fourpence per day,
for lodging-money, and two <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>meals, and one meal for each member
of the family; and on Saturdays double allowance of money, with
an extra meal to take home for each, that they may have no excuse
for begging on Sunday.&nbsp; Each meal in winter consists of a
pint of nutritious soup, and a sixth of a four-pound loaf of good
bread; and in summer one quarter of a pound of cheese, and the
same proportion of bread.&nbsp; At the end of a week, if they
apply, the order for work may be renewed, until they have been
employed a month, when the case is discharged, unless the sitting
manager considers an extension of employment desirable; in which
case it is laid before the committee, who renew the order for
another month, or give such other relief as they think most
likely to prevent the necessity of a recurrence to
street-begging.&nbsp; In order to check repeated applications
from the same persons, those who habitually resort to the refuges
for the houseless, or the metropolitan workhouses, for lodging,
and to the Society for food, if males, have to perform three
hours&rsquo; work at the mill; if females, three hours&rsquo;
work at oakum-picking, before food is given them; and the men may
also, if practicable, have three days&rsquo; work at
stone-breaking.&nbsp; Applicants of this description making more
than six applications within one year are refused further relief,
unless on investigation they are found deserving of
assistance.</p>
<p>Persons who have not been six months in London are not
considered objects of the charity; but food is given to persons
passing through London in search of work, to assist them on their
way.&nbsp; In the case of <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>mendicants incapable of labour, the
amount of daily allowance is 6<i>d.</i> for a single man,
9<i>d.</i> for a man, his wife, and young child, and 1<i>s.</i>
in any other case; but this allowance may be doubled on Saturday
night, at the discretion of the sitting or
assistant-manager.&nbsp; Labourers at the mill receive 6<i>d.</i>
per day, and the wife and children of persons employed may
receive a meal.&nbsp; The wives of men employed either at the
mill or stone-yard may also have work, and receive wages,
provided that their joint earnings do not exceed one shilling per
day.</p>
<p>The Society&rsquo;s &ldquo;Report&rdquo; recently issued shows
the kind and the extent of the business transacted through its
officials up to the close of the year 1867.&nbsp; It contains
much that is interesting as well as instructive, and not a little
that is puzzling.&nbsp; We are informed that within the year 644
vagrants were arrested and taken before a magistrate, and that of
this number 311 were committed, and 333 discharged.&nbsp; From
the commencement to the close of the year 1867, upwards of 10,000
cases of &ldquo;casual&rdquo; relief passed through the hands of
the Society, as well as between 400 and 500 cases that are
alluded to as &ldquo;registered&rdquo;&mdash;a term, it may be
assumed, that distinguishes the ordinary casual case from that
which demands investigation and private inquiry.&nbsp; Amongst
the whole number, 44,347 meals were distributed, and a
considerable sum of money and some clothes; it being no uncommon
occurrence for the management to rig-out the ragged, hard-up
unfortunate applying for relief, and to start him in the world <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>in a way
that, if he has the intention, gives him a fair chance of
recovering a decent position.</p>
<p>The most curious part of the affair, however, appears in the
plain and simple tabulated statement that represents the yearly
number of vagrants relieved and set to work, and consigned to
proper punishment, since the time of the Mendicity
Society&rsquo;s first establishment.&nbsp; In the first year of
the Society&rsquo;s existence, when the scheme was new, and the
vagrant crop dead-ripe for gathering, and the officers eager to
get at their new and novel employment, 385 &ldquo;sturdy
beggars&rdquo; were caught and sent to gaol.&nbsp; It is
consoling to know that in the last year (1867) this number was
decreased considerably, and that no more than 311 were
sentenced.&nbsp; This may appear no vast reduction, but when we
consider not only the enormously-increased population since 1818,
and, what is of equal significance, the advance of intellect and
cleverness and cunning amongst this as every other community
doomed to live by the exercise of its wits, the result is one on
which the country may be congratulated.</p>
<p>When, however, we come to regard the long column that at a
glance reveals the figures that pertain to vagrant committals for
fifty successive years, a decided damper is thrown on one&rsquo;s
hopes that the trade of the shiftless roving vagabond is becoming
surely though slowly extinguished.&nbsp; As might be expected of
a class so erratic in its movements, it would be difficult to
measure them by any fixed standard; but one is scarcely prepared
to discover the awful amount of uncertainty <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>that
prevails as regards the going and coming of these impostor
tramps, when there is a dearth of them, and when their swarming
may be expected.&nbsp; They are like cholera or plague, and have
their seasons of sloth, and again of general prevalence and
virulence.&nbsp; The laws that govern the movements of the
professional beggar are inscrutable.&nbsp; You may make war on
him and thin his ranks, and prosecute him and persecute him, and
by the end of the year be able to show in plain unmistakable
figures that he is not half the formidable fellow he was last
year; that you have blunted his sting and decreased his
dimensions.&nbsp; You still prosecute the war of extermination,
and next year you are in a position to reveal in black-and-white
further glorious results.&nbsp; The thousand has become seven
hundred, and again the seven hundred four.&nbsp; At this rate,
ere two more years are elapsed, you may strip the rags from your
last beggar&rsquo;s back, and hang them on the city gate as a
scarecrow and a caution against a revival of the detestable
trade.</p>
<p>But alas for our delusive hopes!&nbsp; Come another
year&mdash;that which showed our seven hundred beggars dwindled
down to four&mdash;and without any apparent cause the enemy,
crippled and more than half killed as it seemed, reappears on the
stage hale and sound, and with years of life in him yet.&nbsp;
The four hundred has grown to six.&nbsp; There are no means of
accounting for it.&nbsp; Depression of trade and poverty widely
prevailing will not do so, for such are times of prosperity and
fattening with the professional beggar.&nbsp; When
&ldquo;giving&rdquo; is the order <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>of the day, and benevolence,
sickening at the sight of privation and distress that seems
endless, shuts her eyes and bestows her gifts on all comers, then
is the cadger&rsquo;s harvest, then he may pursue his shameful
avocation with comparative impunity.&nbsp; If we required
evidence of this, it is furnished by the Society&rsquo;s
statistics.&nbsp; In 1865, which was an ordinarily fair year with
the working man, the number of vagrant committals reached 586,
while in the year following, when destitution prevailed so
enormously, and the outcries of famine were so generously
responded to through the length and breadth of the land, the
number of begging impostors who got into trouble were only
372.</p>
<p>It will be as well, perhaps, that the reader should have set
before him the figures for the various years precisely as they
stand in the Society&rsquo;s last issued Report.&nbsp; As will be
seen, for some reason that is not explained, there are no returns
for the four years 1830 to 1833 inclusive.&nbsp; Appended to the
&ldquo;committed vagrant list&rdquo; is a record of the number of
cases specially inquired into and &ldquo;registered,&rdquo; as
well as a statement of the number of meals that were in each year
distributed.</p>

</table>
<p>Assuming that the Society constantly employs the same number
of officers, and that they are always maintained in the same
condition of activity, it is difficult to <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>account for
the disparity displayed by the above-quoted figures.&nbsp; It
would almost seem that the mendicity constabulary were gifted
with a prescience of what was about to happen; that they know, by
the barking of dogs or some other unmistakable token, when
&ldquo;the beggars are coming to town,&rdquo; and sallied out, as
fishermen do at the approach of herrings or mackerel, prepared,
and fully determined to make a good haul.</p>
<p>It is a pity that, despite the good work it accomplishes, the
Society for the Suppression of Mendicity should have weighty
reasons for lamenting the falling-off of public support it has of
late experienced.&nbsp; Nothing could be more promising than its
launching.&nbsp; It took the field with a staff of eight
constables only, and an income of 4,384<i>l.</i>; nor could it be
said to disappoint the expectations of its patrons.&nbsp; In its
first year of operation it prosecuted 385 professional
vagrants.&nbsp; Its success progressed.&nbsp; After a lapse of
twenty-five years, in 1842 we find it with an income of
6,576<i>l.</i>; and that prosperity had not dulled its energy
appears from the fact that in the year last mentioned there
occurred, in the deep waters where that slippery and voracious
fish, the incorrigible beggar, lurks for prey, the splendid catch
of over thirteen hundred.&nbsp; Encouraged by so fair a stroke of
business, and the kindness and generosity of an appreciative
public, the Society then added a new branch to their
business&mdash;the begging-letter branch; which, it should be
understood, did not originally come within the scope of its
operations in any shape.</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>At
the expiration of another quarter of a century, however, we find
that, instead of an increase of income to the extent of
one-third, as occurred in the first quarter of a century of the
Society&rsquo;s existence, its resources have fallen off to the
extent of nearly one-half, as compared with the income of
1842.</p>
<p>This is as it should not be.&nbsp; As has been shown, feeding
the deserving poor as well as punishing the inveterate vagrant
comprises a prominent feature of the Society&rsquo;s business,
and this it is impossible to do without adequate funds.&nbsp; It
might be supposed that the passing of the Houseless Poor Act
would have diminished the number of applicants to this and other
charitable societies; but there is a large class of persons
temporarily thrown out of work to whom the casual wards of
workhouses are useless, and who do not apply for assistance
there.&nbsp; The number of this class who applied with tickets at
the Society&rsquo;s office during the past year was more <i>than
double the number of such applicants in the preceding year</i>,
being, in 1866, 4,378; but in 1867, 10,532.&nbsp; Among these
poor persons 44,347 meals, consisting of 7,389 four-pound loaves,
upwards of four tons of cheese and 785 gallons of soup, have been
distributed.&nbsp; In addition to this amount of food,
65<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i>, in small sums of money, has been given to
those whose cases seemed suitable for such relief.</p>
<p>The apprehended cases were 644, as compared with 693 such
cases in 1866; but though a diminished constabulary force was
employed for part of the year, yet nearly as large a number of
old offenders was committed <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>by the magistrate, being 311
compared with 372 in 1866.&nbsp; The number of begging-letters
referred to the office for inquiry during the past year was
2,019, being somewhat fewer than the return of such applications
for the year 1866.&nbsp; Of the 2,019 letters 790 were from
unknown applicants; 620 from persons previously known to the
Society&rsquo;s officials, but requiring a more recent
investigation; and 609 from persons too well known to require any
investigation.</p>
<p>The following cases that have occurred during the past year
will show the mode in which the Society deals with the very
different classes of applicants brought within the sphere of its
operations:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No. 617.&nbsp; F. J.&mdash;This young man,
24 years of age, came to the office with a subscriber&rsquo;s
ticket.&nbsp; He stated that he had been employed last as a
bookkeeper at Manchester, and left that situation in April, and
had since been in London seeking a situation, in which he had
failed, and having no friends here, had become destitute.&nbsp;
He was a well-spoken single man, and appeared to be truthful in
his statements and anxious to return to Manchester, where he had
relatives who would assist him.&nbsp; At the instance of the
presiding manager some old clothes were given him, which improved
his appearance, and thirty shillings were handed to a constable
to pay his fare, which was done, and the balance was given to
him.&nbsp; A few days after he wrote from Manchester a letter, in
which he stated that he had every prospect of obtaining
employment, and expressed much gratitude for what had been done
for him at this office.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>&ldquo;No. 883.&nbsp; S. F.&mdash;This woman, 37 years
of age, applied to the Society with a subscriber&rsquo;s ticket,
alleging her distress to have been caused by the desertion of her
husband and her own inability to procure employment, owing to the
want of decent clothing.&nbsp; She was sent to the
Society&rsquo;s oakum-room to work, and while there saved enough
money to purchase several articles of wearing apparel.&nbsp;
Inquiry was made; and it being found that her statements were
true and her character good, a situation was found her, in which
she still is, apparently giving satisfaction to her employers,
and likely to obtain a respectable living for the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. 169,150.&nbsp; S. W. G.&mdash;This poor woman, the
widow of a labourer, and aged 45 years, had done her best to
bring up her family in credit, by keeping a small coal and
greengrocery shop, making ginger-beer, &amp;c. during the summer
months; and several of the children were nearly providing for
themselves, when she lost her sight, and was found in a state of
distress.&nbsp; Her eldest daughter had been obliged to leave her
situation to look to the house; but having a knowledge of the
sewing-machine and a prospect of obtaining work at home, it was
decided to recommend the case for liberal relief, in order that a
machine might be obtained and the daughter thus enabled to assist
in rearing the younger children at home, which object there is
reason to hope has been accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. 54,494.&nbsp; C. T., <i>alias</i> S.&mdash;A
well-dressed woman was apprehended on a warrant, charging her
with obtaining charitable contributions by false pretences; she
had <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>been
known to the Society&rsquo;s officers for years, and a number of
complaints had been lodged at the office against her during that
time; when apprehended on previous occasions no one could be
found willing to appear against her.&nbsp; In the present
instance she had applied to a lady residing at Rutland-gate for a
loan of 2<i>l.</i> to enable her to take her brother to Scotland,
whom she represented as having just left the Brompton Hospital
very ill, and that she had been advised to get him to his native
air, where they had friends.&nbsp; To strengthen her appeal she
mentioned the names of two or three persons known to the lady to
whom she was applying, and as having been sent by one of them to
her; on the faith of the representations made she was assisted
with 2<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i>; but subsequent inquiry convinced this
lady that the statement was false.&nbsp; At the time the prisoner
was taken into custody she had 5<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i>
5&frac12;<i>d.</i> on her person; and being made acquainted with
the charge confessed herself guilty of these offences, and
offered to repay the money; but on the case being stated to the
magistrate he sentenced her to three months&rsquo; imprisonment,
and the money found in her possession to be applied to her
maintenance while there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. 42,064.&nbsp; T. B., with a number of aliases, was
again apprehended by one of the Society&rsquo;s constables; he
had been known as a begging-letter impostor for upwards of twenty
years, and during that period had been three times transported,
and as many times liberated on tickets-of-leave.&nbsp; On this
occasion (in company <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>with a woman whom he represented as
a district visitor) he applied to a gentleman residing in
Eaton-square, stating he was &lsquo;Mr. Bond,&rsquo; one of the
overseers of St. Marylebone parish, and gave in his card to that
effect.&nbsp; On obtaining an interview, he said he and the lady
with him had interested themselves on behalf of a &lsquo;Mrs.
Cole,&rsquo; a widow with six children, a native of Ledbury in
Herefordshire, who wished to return home, where she would be able
to obtain a living for herself and family, and he was seeking
subscriptions to purchase the family a little clothing and funds
to defray the expense of their transit.&nbsp; The gentleman
knowing Ledbury well, and believing the prisoner&rsquo;s
statement to be true, gave him 10<i>s.</i>; but afterwards
finding that he had been imposed on, obtained a warrant for his
apprehension, and the case being clearly proved, he was sentenced
to three months&rsquo; imprisonment; and the magistrate remarked
that a more hardened criminal had never been brought before him,
and that the Home Secretary should be applied to to cause him to
finish his unexpired term of two years and three
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. 54,889.&nbsp; M. W.&mdash;A woman with an infant in
her arms was apprehended by one of the Society&rsquo;s constables
for endeavouring to obtain money by false pretences from a
gentleman residing in Portland-place, by stating that her husband
was at the Bournemouth Sanatorium, and produced a letter
purporting to be from the medical officer of the institution,
which was as follows: &lsquo;National Sanatorium, Bournemouth,
Hants.&mdash;<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>The resident surgeon wishes to inform Mrs. W. that her
husband, having ruptured a blood-vessel, is in a very precarious
state.&nbsp; James W. is very desirous of seeing his wife, and
begs she will come as early as possible.&rsquo;&nbsp; This note
was signed as by the resident medical officer.&nbsp; She stated
to the prosecutor that having no means of paying her railway
fare, she had applied to him for assistance, as he had been kind
to her husband on previous occasions.&nbsp; Being apprehended and
detained for inquiries, she admitted the truth of the charge made
against her; and the case being clearly proved, she was sentenced
to three months&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; The prisoner and her
husband had been carrying on this system of imposition for a long
time, but owing to parties declining to come forward to
prosecute, had not previously been convicted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there remains yet to notice one member of the
begging-letter-writing fraternity, compared with whom all the
rest are mere innocent and harmless scribblers.&nbsp; After an
experience so long and varied, and so many conflicts sharp and
severe with their natural enemies the officers of the
&ldquo;Society,&rdquo; and so many exposures and defeats, it
might be reasonably hoped that the professional beggar whose
genius takes an epistolary turn must find his ingenuity well-nigh
exhausted; but, as recent revelations have disclosed, the
machinery brought against him for his suppression has but
sharpened his wits and rendered him more formidable than
ever.&nbsp; Although but recently discovered, it is hard to <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>say for how
long a time this diabolical desire for swindling the unwary has
existed.&nbsp; Very possibly, many a &ldquo;dodge&rdquo; of minor
calibre has been invented and run the length of its tether, and
died the death of all dodges, while the one in question has
lurked in the dark, and grown fat and prospered.</p>
<p>It would be next to impossible for the imagination most
fertile in wicked invention to conceive anything more devilish
and mischievous, or an evil that might be perpetrated with less
fear of detection.&nbsp; The mainspring of the pretty scheme is
not to impose on the benevolence and credulity of the living, but
to blast and vilify the character of the dead.&nbsp; To
obliterate from the hearts of those who were nearest and dearest
to him&mdash;the husband dead and buried&mdash;all kindly
remembrance of him; to tear, as it were, from his poor honest
body the white shroud in which tender hands had enveloped it, and
show him to have lived and died a traitor, a hypocrite, and an
impostor, false to that very last breath with which he bade his
wife, his &ldquo;only darling,&rdquo; farewell; and this that
some cold-blooded ruffian may extort from the wronged man&rsquo;s
duped indignant survivors a few miserable pounds or shillings, as
the case may be.</p>
<p>The process by which the villany in question may be
accomplished is much more simple than would at first
appear.&nbsp; The prime condition of the impostor&rsquo;s success
is that he must reside at a long distance from those it is his
intention to dupe.&nbsp; The swindler lives in France or Germany,
sometimes as far away as <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>America.&nbsp; The first
&ldquo;move&rdquo; is to look into the newspaper obituary notices
for a likely victim.&nbsp; A gentleman who dies young, leaving a
wife and a numerous family to bemoan their bitter bereavement, is
not uncommonly the case fixed on.&nbsp; If, during his lifetime,
he was a man who, from his station in life, must have been
tolerably well known, so much the better.&nbsp; It is a woman who
writes the letter.&nbsp; She writes of course to the individual
as though not in the least suspecting that he is dead.&nbsp; The
following <i>genuine</i> copy of such a letter will, better than
anything, illustrate the cold, cruel, subtle villany essential to
the success of the &ldquo;Dead-man&rsquo;s lurk,&rdquo; as in the
profession it is styled:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My ever-dearest Robert,&mdash;It is only
after enduring the sickening disappointment that has attended my
last three letters sent to the old address, that I venture to
write to your private abode, in the fervent hope that this my
desperate appeal to your oft-tried generosity may fall into no
other hands but your own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think that my boy&rsquo;s father can have
grown cold towards her whose whole life is devoted to him, who
fled from home and friends, and took up her abode in a foreign
land and amongst strangers, that her darling might not be
troubled,&mdash;that his <i>home</i> might be peace.&nbsp; Alas!
what is <i>my</i> home?&nbsp; But I will not upbraid you.&nbsp;
Were I alone, I would be content to die rather than cause you a
single pang of uneasiness; but, as my dear Robert knows, I am
<i>not</i> alone.&nbsp; God still spares our boy to me, though I
much fear that the doctor&rsquo;s <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>prediction that he would get the
better of his ailments when he had turned the age of ten will not
be verified.&nbsp; Sometimes as I sit of nights&mdash;long,
weary, thoughtful nights&mdash;watching my sick darling, and
thinking of those old times of brief bitter sweetness, I wish
that you could see him, so like your own dear self; but the
thought is at once hushed, when I reflect on the pain it would
cause you to contemplate our poor <i>fatherless</i> boy.&nbsp; I
am almost tempted to thank God that he cannot remain much longer
on earth; but it is hard, cruelly hard, to see him suffer from
<i>want</i> as well as from his painful malady.&nbsp; Do, for the
sake of the <i>old times</i>, send me a little money, though only
a few pounds.&nbsp; There is no other resource for us but the
workhouse.&nbsp; At any rate, pray send me an answer to this, and
relieve the dreadful suspense that haunts me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&nbsp; As I have been, from reasons too painful to
disclose to you, compelled to quit the lodgings in V.-street,
please direct Post-office, &mdash;.&nbsp; Yours, ever true and
faithful,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>
&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it happened, the gentleman to whom this villanous epistle
was addressed had, till within a few years of his demise, resided
in a far-away quarter of the globe, and under such conditions as
rendered a ten-years-ago intimacy with any English Elizabeth
utterly impossible; but unfortunately his survivors were content
to treat the attempted imposture with silent contempt, and a
likely opportunity of bringing to proper punishment one of a gang
of the most pestiferous order <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>of swindlers it is possible to
conceive was lost.&nbsp; It was probably only the <i>very</i>
peculiar and exceptionally conclusive evidence that the letter
could not apply to Mr. Robert &mdash;, that saved his friends
from painful anxiety, and perhaps robbery.&nbsp; It is so much
less troublesome to hush-up such a matter than to investigate
it.&nbsp; To be sure, no one would have for a moment suspected,
from the precise and proper behaviour of the man dead and gone,
that he could ever have been guilty of such wickedness and folly;
but it is so hard to read the human heart.&nbsp; Such things have
happened; and now that one calls to mind&mdash;</p>
<p>That is the most poisonous part of it,&mdash;&ldquo;now that
one calls to mind!&rdquo;&nbsp; What is easier than to call to
mind, out of the ten thousand remembrances of a man whose society
we have shared for twenty years or more, one or two acts that at
the time were regarded as &ldquo;strange whims,&rdquo; but now,
regarded in the light that the damnable letter sheds on them,
appear as parts of the very business so unexpectedly brought to
light?&nbsp; Perhaps the man was privately charitable, and in
benevolent objects expended a portion of his income, without
making mention of how, when, and where, or keeping any sort of
ledger account.&nbsp; How his means so mysteriously dwindled in
his hands was a puzzle even to his most intimate
friends&mdash;<i>now</i> it is apparent where the money
went!&nbsp; But there, it is no use discussing that now; he has
gone to answer for all his sins, and it is to be devoutly wished
that God, in the infinite stretch of His mercy, will forgive him
even this enormous sin.&nbsp; <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>Meanwhile it will never do to have
this base creature coming as a tramping beggar, perhaps with her
boy, and knocking at the door, desperately determined on being
cared for by the man who was the cause of her ruin and her
banishment.&nbsp; Better to send her ten pounds, with a brief
note to the effect that Mr. &mdash; is now dead, and it will be
useless her troubling again. This is what did <i>not</i> happen
in the case quoted, and for the reasons given; but it might, and
in very many cases it doubtless has happened; and it would be
worth a whole year&rsquo;s catch of common begging-letter
impostors if the Society for the Suppression of Mendicity could
trap a member of the &ldquo;Dead-lurk&rdquo; gang, and hand him
over to the tender mercies of the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> &ldquo;dodges&rdquo; to which
an individual resolved on a vagrant life will resort are almost
past reckoning; and, as a natural consequence, the quality of the
imposture in modern practice is superior to that which served to
delude our grandfathers.</p>
<p>It can be no other.&nbsp; As civilisation advances, and our
machinery for the suppression and detection of fraud improves,
so, if he would live at all, must the professional impostor exert
all the skill and cunning he is endowed with to adjust the
balance at his end of the beam.&nbsp; It is with vagrancy as with
thieving.&nbsp; If our present system of police had no more
formidable adversaries to deal with than lived and robbed in the
days of those famous fellows, Richard Turpin and Master Blueskin,
Newgate might, in the course <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>of a few years, be converted into a
temperance hotel, and our various convict establishments into
vast industrial homes for the helplessly indigent.&nbsp; So, if
the well-trained staff under the captaincy of that shrewd scenter
of make-believe and humbug&mdash;Mr. Horsford&mdash;was called on
to rout an old-fashioned army of sham blindness, and cripples
whose stumps were fictitious; and of clumsy whining cadgers, who
made filthy rags do duty for poverty, who painted horrid sores on
their arms and legs, and employed a mild sort of whitewash to
represent on their impudent faces the bloodless pallor of
consumption,&mdash;we might reasonably hope to be rid of the
whole community in a month.</p>
<p>It is scarcely too much to say, that the active and
intelligent opposition brought to bear of late years against
beggars has caused the trade to be taken up by a class of persons
of quite superior accomplishments.&nbsp; I well recollect, on the
memorable occasion of my passing a night in the society of tramps
and beggars, hearing the matter discussed seriously and at
length, and that by persons who, from their position in life,
undoubtedly were those to whose opinion considerable weight
attached.&nbsp; The conversation began by one young fellow, as he
reclined on his hay-bed and puffed complacently at his short
pipe, relating how he had &ldquo;kidded&rdquo; the workhouse
authorities into the belief that he had not applied for relief at
that casual-ward for at least a month previously, whereas he had
been there for three successive nights.&nbsp; Of course this was
a joke mightily enjoyed by his audience; and a friend, wagging
his head <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>in high admiration, expressed his wonder as to how the
feat could be successfully accomplished.&nbsp; &ldquo;How!&rdquo;
replied the audacious one; &ldquo;why, with cheek, to be
sure.&nbsp; Anything can be done if you&rsquo;ve only got cheek
enough.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use puttin&rsquo; on a spurt of it,
and knocking under soon as you&rsquo;re tackled.&nbsp; Go in for
it up to the heads of your &mdash; soul bolts.&nbsp; Put it on
your face so gallus thick that the devil himself won&rsquo;t see
through it.&nbsp; Put it into your eyes and set the tears
a-rollin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Swear God&rsquo;s truth; stop at
nothing.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re bound to believe you.&nbsp; There
ain&rsquo;t nothing else left for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; They think
that there&rsquo;s an end somewhere to lyin&rsquo; and
cheekin&rsquo;, and they&rsquo;re &mdash; fools enough to think
that they can tell when that end shows itself.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
let your cheek have any end to it.&nbsp; <i>That&rsquo;s</i>
where you&rsquo;re right, my lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have, at the risk of shocking the reader of delicate
sensibilities, quoted at full the terms in which my ruffianly
&ldquo;casual&rdquo; chamber-fellow delivered himself of his
opinion as to the power of &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; illimitable,
because from the same experienced source presently proceeded as
handsome a tribute to the efficiency of the officers of the
Mendicity Society as they could desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall you do with yerself to-morrow?&rdquo; one
asked of another, who, weary of song and anecdote and blasphemy,
preparatory to curling down for the night was yawning curses on
the parochial authorities for supplying him with no warmer
rug.&nbsp; &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t much you can do anyhows atween
the time when you finish at the crank and go out, till when you
wants to come in agin.&nbsp; It feels like frost; if it is, I
shall do a bit of <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>chanting, I think.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Chanting&rdquo;
is vagrant phraseology for street singing.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; replied his friend;
&ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s cold enough to work the shaller;
that&rsquo;s the best game.&nbsp; &rsquo;Taint no use, though,
without its perishin&rsquo; cold; that&rsquo;s the wust on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(It may be here mentioned that the &ldquo;shaller,&rdquo; or
more properly &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; dodge, is for a beggar to
make capital of his rags and a disgusting condition of
semi-nudity; to expose his shoulders and his knees and his
shirtless chest, pinched and blue with cold.&nbsp; A pouncing of
the exposed parts with common powder-blue is found to heighten
the frost-bitten effect, and to excite the compassion of the
charitable.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are wrong,&rdquo; broke in the advocate of
&ldquo;cheek;&rdquo; &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t the wust of
it.&nbsp; The wust of it is, that there&rsquo;s no <i>best</i> of
it.&nbsp; It don&rsquo;t matter what you try; all games is
a-growing stale as last week&rsquo;s tommy&rdquo; (bread).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;cos people get so gallus
&rsquo;ard-&rsquo;arted, that&rsquo;s wot it is,&rdquo; remarked
with a grin a young gentleman who shared the bed of the
&lsquo;cheeky&rsquo; one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that ain&rsquo;t it, either; people are as
soft-&rsquo;arted and as green as ever they was; and so they
would shell-out like they used to do, only for them
&mdash;&rdquo; (something too dreadful for printing)
&ldquo;lurchers of the S&rsquo;ciety.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all
them.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t the reg&rsquo;lar p&rsquo;lice.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re above beggars, &rsquo;cept when they&rsquo;re set
on.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s them Mendikent coves, wot gets their
livin&rsquo; by pokin&rsquo; and pryin&rsquo; arter every cove
like us whenever they sees him in the street.&nbsp; <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>They gives
the public the &lsquo;office&rsquo;&rdquo; (information),
&ldquo;and the public believes &rsquo;em, bust
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These observations evidently set the &ldquo;cheeky&rdquo; one
thinking on times past; for he presently took up the subject
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things ain&rsquo;t wot they was one time.&nbsp;
Talkin&rsquo; about the shallow lay; Lor&rsquo; bless yer, you
should have knowed what it was no longer ago than when I was a
kid, and used to go out with my old woman.&nbsp; Ah, it was
summat to have winter then!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heerd my old woman
say often that she&rsquo;d warrant to make enough to live on all
the rest of the year, if she only had three months&rsquo; good
stiff frost.&nbsp; I recollect the time when you couldn&rsquo;t
go a dozen yards without hearing the flying up of a window or the
opening of a door, and there was somebody a-beckoning of you to
give you grub or coppers.&nbsp; It was the grub that beat
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye mean?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you get enough
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark at him! enough of it!&nbsp; We got a
thunderin&rsquo; sight too much of it.&nbsp; A little of it was
all very well, &rsquo;specially if it was a handy-sized meaty
bone, wot you could relish with a pint of beer when you felt
peckish; but, bust &rsquo;em, they used to overdo it.&nbsp; It
don&rsquo;t look well, don&rsquo;t you know, to carry a bag or
anythink, when you are on the shallow lay.&nbsp; It looks as
though you was a &lsquo;reg&rsquo;lar,&rsquo; and that
don&rsquo;t &lsquo;act.&rsquo;&nbsp; The old gal used to stow a
whacking lot in a big pocket she had in her petticut, and I used
to put away a &lsquo;dollop&rsquo; in the busum of my shirt,
which it was tied round the waist-bag hid underneath my trousers
for the purpose.&nbsp; But, Lor&rsquo; bless yer, <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>sometimes
the blessed trade would go that aggravatin&rsquo; that we would
both find ourselves loaded-up in no time.&nbsp; Lor, how my old
woman would swear about the grub sometimes!&nbsp; It used to make
me larf; it was a reg&rsquo;lar pantermime.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d be
reg&rsquo;lar weighed down, and me stuffed so jolly full that I
daren&rsquo;t so much as shiver even, lest a lump of tommy or
meat should tumble out in front, and all the while we&rsquo;d be
pattering about us not having eat a mouthful since the day afore
yesterday.&nbsp; Then somebody &rsquo;ud beckon us; and
p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps it was a servant-gal, with enough in a dish
for a man and his dawg.&nbsp; And the old woman &rsquo;bliged to
curtchy and look pleased!&nbsp; They ought to have heard
her!&nbsp; &lsquo;D&mdash; and b&mdash; &rsquo;em!&rsquo; my old
gal used to say between her teeth, &lsquo;I wish they had them
broken wittles stuffed down their busted throats; why the &mdash;
can&rsquo;t they give us it in coppers!&rsquo;&nbsp; But she
couldn&rsquo;t say that to them, don&rsquo;t yer know; she had to
put on a grateful mug, and say, &lsquo;Gord bless yer, my
dear!&rsquo; to the gal, as though, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
that lot of grub turning up that blessed minute, she must have
dropped down dead of starvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But scran fetched its price in them times, didn&rsquo;t
it, Billy?&nbsp; There was drums where you might sell it long
afore your time, don&rsquo;t you know, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I know.&nbsp; It fetched its price,
cert&rsquo;inly, when you could get away to sell it; but what
I&rsquo;m speaking of is the inconwenience of it.&nbsp; We
didn&rsquo;t want no grub, don&rsquo;t you see; it was the
sp&rsquo;iling of us.&nbsp; S&rsquo;pose now we was served like
what I just told you; <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>got reg&rsquo;lar loaded-up when we
was a couple of miles away.&nbsp; What was we to do?&nbsp; We
couldn&rsquo;t go on a swearin&rsquo; as how we was
starvin&rsquo; with wittles bustin&rsquo; out of us all
round.&nbsp; We was &rsquo;bliged to shoot the load afore we
could begin ag&rsquo;in.&nbsp; Sometimes we had to do the
&lsquo;long trot&rsquo;&rdquo; (go home) &ldquo;with it, and so
sp&rsquo;iled a whole arternoon.&nbsp; If we got a chance, we
shot it down a gully, or in a dunghole in a mews.&nbsp; Anythink
to get rid of it, don&rsquo;t you see.&nbsp; I should like to
have just now the rattlin&rsquo; lot of grub we&rsquo;ve been
&rsquo;bliged to get rid of in that there way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the decline of the trade of &ldquo;shallowing,&rdquo;
however, as the reader must have observed, it is one that is
regarded as worth resorting to in &ldquo;season.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
more favourite &ldquo;dodge&rdquo; at the present is to appear
before the public not in rags and tatters and with patches of
naked flesh disgustingly visible, but in sound thorough
labour-stained attire, and affect the style either of the ashamed
unaccustomed beggar or that of the honest working mechanic, who,
desperately driven by stress of poverty, shapes his loud-mouthed
appeal in tones of indignant remonstrance that rich and
prosperous England should permit a man such as he is to be
reduced to the uncomfortable plight in which you now behold
him.&nbsp; He is a solitary cadger, and gets himself up in a
manner so artful, that it is only when you pay attention to his
&ldquo;speech,&rdquo; and find that he repeats precisely the same
words over and over again, that you begin to have a suspicion
that he is not exactly what he seems.&nbsp; Like the
&ldquo;shallow cove,&rdquo; he prefers a very cold <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>or a very
wet and miserable day.&nbsp; He does not enter a street walking
in the middle of the road, as the common &ldquo;chanting&rdquo;
or &ldquo;pattering&rdquo; beggar does; he walks on the pavement
with slow and hesitating gait, and at frequent intervals casts
hasty and nervous glances behind him, as though fearful that he
is watched or followed.&nbsp; Possibly he is so afraid.&nbsp; At
all events, should a policeman by rare chance steal round the
corner, his steps will increase in length, and he will pass out
of the street just as an ordinary pedestrian might; but should he
be free to play his &ldquo;little game,&rdquo; he will set about
it as follows.</p>
<p>After looking about him several times, he proceeds to make
himself remarkable to any person or persons who may happen to be
gazing streetward from the window.&nbsp; He will stand suddenly
still, and button-up his coat as though determined on some
desperate action.&nbsp; With a loud-sounding &ldquo;hem!&rdquo;
he clears his throat and advances towards the roadway; but, alas,
before his feet touch the pavement&rsquo;s boundary his courage
falters, and he dashes his hand across his eyes and shakes his
head, in a manner that at once conveys to beholders the
impression that, much as he desires it, he is unequal to the
performance of what a moment ago he contemplated and thought
himself strong enough to perform.&nbsp; At least, if this is not
made manifest to the beholder, the actor has missed his
object.&nbsp; On he goes again just a few faltering steps&mdash;a
very few&mdash;and then he cries &ldquo;hem!&rdquo; again, louder
and fiercer than before, and dashes into the middle of the
road.</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>If
you had pushed him there, or set your dog at him and he had
bounded there to escape its fangs, the injured look he casts up
at you could not be surpassed.&nbsp; He says not a word for a
full minute; he simply folds his arms sternly and glares at you
up at the window, as though he would say not so much &ldquo;What
do you think of me standing here?&rdquo; as &ldquo;What do you
think of yourself, after having driven me to do a thing so
ignominious and shameful?&rdquo;&nbsp; These necessary
preliminaries accomplished, in a loud impassioned voice he
opens:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">What</span>!&rdquo;&mdash;(a pause
of some seconds&rsquo; duration)&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">What</span>! will a man not do to drive away from
his door the <span class="GutSmall">WOLF</span> that assails the
wife of his bosom and his innocent horfspring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appears to await an answer to this, as though it were a
solemn conundrum; though from the moody contraction of his
eyebrows and the momentary scorn that wrinkles the corners of his
mouth as he still gazes all round at the windows, he seems to be
aware that it is one which on account of your complete ignorance
of such matters you will never guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless, my friends, you are astonished to see me in
this humiliating attitude, addressing you like a common
beggar.&nbsp; But what else am I?&nbsp; What is the man who
implores you to spare him from your plenty&mdash;ay, and your
luxury&mdash;a <i>penny</i> to save from starving those that are
dearer to him than his <span
class="GutSmall">HEART&rsquo;S</span> blood, but a beggar?&nbsp;
But, my friends, a man may be a beggar, and still be not
ashamed.&nbsp; <i>I</i> am not ashamed.&nbsp; I might be, if it
was for myself that I asked your charity; but I <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>would not
do so.&nbsp; I would die sooner than I would stoop to do it; but
what is a <span class="GutSmall">HUSBAND</span> to do, when he
has a wife weak and ill from her confinement; who is dying by
<span class="GutSmall">HINCHES</span> for that nourishment that I
have not to give her?&rdquo;&nbsp; (Here a violent blowing of his
nose on a clean cotton pocket-handkerchief.)&nbsp; &ldquo;What,
my dear friends, is a <span class="GutSmall">FATHER</span> to do,
when his little ones cry to him for <span
class="GutSmall">BREAD</span>?&nbsp; Should he feel ashamed to
beg for them?&nbsp; Ask yourselves that question, you who have
good warm fires and all that the heart can desire.&nbsp; I am
<i>not</i> ashamed.&nbsp; It is a desperate man&rsquo;s last
resource; and I ask you again, as my fellow-creatures, will you
turn away from me and deny me the small assistance I beg of
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Generally he is successful.&nbsp; Women&mdash;young mothers
and old mothers alike&mdash;find it hard to resist the artless
allusion to the wife, &ldquo;weak and ill from her
confinement,&rdquo; and the amazingly well-acted sudden outburst
of emotion that the actor is so anxious to conceal under cover of
blowing his nose.&nbsp; To be sure he is not a prepossessing
person, and his style of appeal is somewhat coarse and violent;
but that stamps it, in the eyes of the unwary, as genuine.&nbsp;
If he &ldquo;knew the trade,&rdquo; he would know that he should
be meek and insinuating, not loud-mouthed and peremptory.&nbsp;
In short, his behaviour is exactly that of a man&mdash;a
hard-working fellow when he has it to do&mdash;driven to
desperation, and with a determination to raise enough to buy a
loaf somehow.&nbsp; It would be a monstrous thing to refuse such
a poor fellow because of his blunt inapt way of asking; and <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>so the
halfpence come showering down.&nbsp; It is several months ago
since I last saw this worthy; but I have no doubt that his wife
has not yet recovered from her confinement, that his children are
yet crying for bread, and that he is still not ashamed to solicit
public charity to save them from starving.</p>
<p>There are other types of the shy, blunt-spoken beggar, who
affect almost to resent the charity they solicit.&nbsp; These
abound, as indeed do all street-beggars, chiefly in the severest
months of winter.&nbsp; As long as one can remember, gangs of men
have perambulated the highways in the frosty months, but until
recently they were invariably &ldquo;chanters,&rdquo; with a
legend of coming &ldquo;all the way from Manchester.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But song is eschewed in modern times.&nbsp; It is found better to
avoid old-fashioned forms, and appear as men destitute and
down-trodden perhaps, but still with self-respect remaining in
them.&nbsp; There is no occasion for them to give you a song for
your money; they are not called on to give a lengthy and
humiliating explanation as to how they came there; <i>you</i>
know all about it.&nbsp; You must have read in the newspapers,
&ldquo;that, owing to the many stoppages of public and private
works, there are at the present time hundreds of able-bodied and
deserving labouring men wandering the streets of London, driven
to the hard necessity of begging their bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well,
these are of the number.&nbsp; Observe the unmistakable token of
their having laboured on a &ldquo;public work,&rdquo; to wit, a
railway-cutting, in the clay baked on their
&ldquo;ankle-jacks&rdquo; and fustian trousers.&nbsp; Regard that
able-bodied individual, <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>the leader of the gang, with his
grimy great fists and the smut still on his face, and for a
moment doubt that he is a deserving labouring man.&nbsp; He is an
engineer, out of work since last Christmas, and ever since so
hard-up that he has been unable to spare a penny to buy soap
with.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t believe it, ask him.&nbsp; But to
this or any other detail himself or his mates will not condescend
in a general way.&nbsp; All that they do, is to spread across the
street, and saunter along with their hands in their pockets,
ejaculating only, &ldquo;Out of work!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Willin&rsquo; to work, and got no work to do!&rdquo;&nbsp;
If you followed them all day, you would find no change in their
method of operation, excepting the interval of an hour or so at
midday spent in the tap-room of a public-house.&nbsp; If you
followed them after that, your steps in all probability would be
directed towards Keate-street, Spitalfields, or Mint-street in
the Borough, in both of which delightful localities common
lodging-houses abound; and if you were bold enough to cross the
threshold and descend into the kitchen, there you would discover
the jolly crew sitting round a table, and dividing the handsome
spoil of the day, while they drank &ldquo;long lasting to the
frost&rdquo; in glasses of neat rum.</p>
<p>At the same time, I should be very sorry for the reader to
misunderstand me, as wishing to convey to him the impression that
in every instance the gangs of men to be met with in the streets
in winter-time are vagrants and impostors.&nbsp; It is not
difficult to imagine a company of hard-up poor fellows genuinely
destitute; mates, perhaps, on the same kind of work, resorting <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>to this
method of raising a shilling rather than apply at the workhouse
for it.&nbsp; An out-o&rsquo;-work navvy or a bricklayer would
never think of going out to beg alone, whereas he would see no
great amount of degradation in joining a
&ldquo;gang.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thus sinks his individuality, and
becomes merely a representative item of a depressed branch of
industry.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that a sixpence given to
such a man is well bestowed for the time being; but it would be
much better, even though it cost many sixpences, if the labourer
were never permitted to adopt this method of supplying his
needs.&nbsp; In the majority of cases, it may be, the
out-o&rsquo;-work man who resorted to the streets to beg for
money would, when trade improved, hurry back to work, and be
heartily glad to forget to what misfortune had driven him; but
there are a very large number of labourers who, at the best of
times, can live but from hand to mouth as the saying is, and from
whom it is desirable to keep secret how much easier money may be
got by begging than working.&nbsp; To a man who has to drudge at
the docks, for instance, for threepence an hour&mdash;and there
are thousands in London who do so&mdash;it is a dangerous
experience for him to discover that as much may be made on an
average by sauntering the ordinary length of a street,
occasionally raising his hand to his cap.&nbsp; Or he may know
beforehand, by rumour, what a capital day&rsquo;s work may be
done at &ldquo;cadging,&rdquo; and in bitter sweat of underpaid
labour complain that he is worse off than a cadger.&nbsp; It is
as well to provide against giving such a man an excuse for
breaking the ice.</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>There
are, however, other impostors amongst the begging fraternity
besides those who adopt the professional dress of vagrancy, and
impudently endeavour publicly to proclaim their sham distress and
privation.&nbsp; The terrible condition of want into which
thousands of the working population of London were plunged the
winter before last developed the &ldquo;cadger&rdquo; in question
in a very remarkable degree.&nbsp; This personage is not a
demonstrative cheat.&nbsp; His existence is due entirely to the
growing belief in decent poverty, and in the conviction that in
frosty &ldquo;hard-up&rdquo; times much more of real destitution
is endured by those whose honest pride will not permit them to
clamour of their wants, and so make them known.&nbsp; There can
be no doubt but that this is perfectly true, and, despite all
that horridly blunt philanthropists say to the contrary, it is a
quality to be nurtured rather than despised.&nbsp; As everybody
knows, of late years it <i>has</i> been nurtured to a very large
extent.&nbsp; At the East-end of the town, in Poplar and
Shadwell, where, owing to the slackness in the trade pertaining
to the building of ships, poverty was specially prevalent, quite
a small army of benevolently-disposed private individuals were
daily employed going from house to house, and by personal inquiry
and investigation applying the funds at their disposal quietly
and delicately, and to the best of then ability
judiciously.&nbsp; There can be no question that by these means a
vast amount of good was done, and many a really decent family
provided with a meal that otherwise would have gone hungry; but
an alarming percentage <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>of evil clung to the skirts of the
good.&nbsp; It is a positive fact that in the most squalid
regions&mdash;those, indeed, that were most notorious for their
poverty&mdash;the value of house-property increased
considerably.&nbsp; The occupants of apartments, who during the
previous summertime were unable to meet the weekly exactions of
the collector, now not only met current demands, but by
substantial instalments rapidly paid-up arrears of rent.&nbsp;
Landlords who for months past had been glad to take what they
could get, now became inexorable, and would insist on one week
being paid before the next was due.&nbsp; They could afford to
indulge in this arbitrary line of behaviour towards their
tenants.&nbsp; Rents were &ldquo;going up;&rdquo; rooms that at
ordinary times would realise not more than 2<i>s.</i> or
2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> each, now were worth 3<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; Ragman&rsquo;s-alley and Squalor&rsquo;s-court
and Great and Little Grime&rsquo;s-street were at a
premium.&nbsp; They were localities famous in the
newspapers.&nbsp; Everybody had read about them; everybody had
heard the story of the appalling heart-rending misery that
pervaded these celebrated places.&nbsp; Day after day gentlefolks
flocked thereto, and speedily following these visitations came
tradesmen&rsquo;s porters bearing meat and bread and
groceries.&nbsp; To be a Squalor&rsquo;s-alleyite was to be a
person with undoubted and indisputable claims on the public
purse, and to be comfortably provided for.&nbsp; To be a denizen
of Great Grime&rsquo;s-street was to reside in an almshouse more
fatly endowed than the Printers&rsquo; or the Drapers&rsquo; or
the Fishmongers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It was impossible for such a paradise to exist without <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>its fame
being blown to the most distant and out-of-the-way nooks of the
town.&nbsp; North, west, and south the cadgers and impostors
heard of it, and enviously itched to participate in the good
things.&nbsp; And no wonder!&nbsp; Here was bread and meat and
coals being furnished to all who asked for them, at the rate of
twenty shillingsworth a-week at the least; nay, they were
provided without even the asking for.&nbsp; It was unnecessary to
cross the threshold of your door to look after them, for those
whose happy task it was to distribute the prizes came knocking,
and in the tenderest terms made offer of their assistance.&nbsp;
All that was needful was to secure a lodging in
Ragman&rsquo;s-court or Little Grime&rsquo;s-street, and pay your
rent regularly, and sit down and await the result.&nbsp; And
lodgings were so secured.&nbsp; It is positively true that at the
height of the &ldquo;famine season&rdquo; at the East-end of
London, when day after day saw the columns of the daily
newspapers heavily laden with the announced subscriptions of the
charitable, hundreds of questionable characters, &ldquo;working
men&rdquo; in appearance, quitted other parts of the metropolis,
and cheerfully paid much more rent than they had been accustomed
to pay, for the privilege of squatting down in the midst of what
was loudly and incessantly proclaimed to be &ldquo;a colony of
helpless out-o&rsquo;-works, famine-stricken, and kept from
downright starvation only by the daily and hourly efforts of the
charitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This much might of course be expected of the professed beggar
and the cadger by education and breeding; <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>but it
would be interesting to learn how many shiftless ones&mdash;those
semi-vagabonds who labour under the delusion that they are idle
men only because work is denied them, and who are continually
engaged in the vague occupation of &ldquo;looking for a
job&rdquo;&mdash;gave way before the great temptation, and became
downright cadgers from that time.&nbsp; With such folk the
barrier to be broken down is of the flimsiest texture, and once
overcome, it is difficult indeed to erect it again.&nbsp; Not
sweeter to the industrious is the bread of their labour than to
the idle and dissolute the loaf unearned, and the free gift of
tobacco to be smoked at ease in working hours.&nbsp; It is
terribly hard to struggle out of a slough of laziness in which a
man has lain for a length of time, with nothing to do but open
his mouth and permit other people to feed him.&nbsp; It is
extremely unlikely that such a man would make the struggle while
there remained but half a chance of his maintaining his
comfortable position.&nbsp; Having grown so far used to the
contamination of mire, he would be more likely to struggle a
little deeper into it, if he saw what he deemed his advantage in
doing so, and by swift degrees he would speedily be engulfed in
that hopeless bog of confirmed beggary from which there is no
return save those of the prison statician.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GENTEEL ADVERTISING BEGGARS.</span></h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Newspaper Plan and the delicate
Process</i>&mdash;<i>Forms of Petition</i>&mdash;<i>Novel
Applications of Photography</i>&mdash;<i>Personal Attractions of
the Distressed</i>&mdash;<i>Help</i>, <i>or I perish</i>!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> those I have enumerated,
there are at least two other specimens of the beggar tribe that
deserve mention.&nbsp; They are genteel impostors both.&nbsp; One
avails himself of the advertising columns of the newspaper to
apprise the benevolent of his modest desires, while the other
prefers the more private and delicate process insured by our
modern postal system.&nbsp; Both affect the &ldquo;reduced
gentleman,&rdquo; and display in their appeals an amount of
artlessness and simple confidence in the charity of their
fellow-creatures that tells unmistakably of their ample
possession of that Christian virtue, while at the same time it
conveys to the reader an idea of the select and highly-exclusive
position they should properly occupy, and from which they have so
disastrously descended.&nbsp; It is evident at a glance that they
know nothing of the rough-and-ready ways of the world, or of its
close-fistedness or proneness to suspicion.&nbsp; We know this,
and pity them; otherwise we might be inclined to <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>class them
with those &ldquo;cheeky&rdquo; ones in whose praise the young
gentleman before mentioned, of &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; extraction,
was so hearty, and to treat their impudent attempts as they
deserve.&nbsp; But the touching simplicity of the unfortunate
creatures at once disarms us of suspicion.&nbsp; For instance,
who could refrain from immediately responding to the subjoined
&ldquo;petition,&rdquo; which is copied strictly from the
original?&nbsp; It was delivered through the post, and was
attached as a fly-leaf to a card on which was affixed the
portraits of six young children, each of whom had evidently been
&ldquo;got up&rdquo; with extreme care, as regards hair-curling
and arrangements of dress and ribbons, for the photographic
process.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Children to
save</i>.&mdash;Advertisement sent to a few taken from the London
Directory.&nbsp; The father of these British-born Protestant
children is an elderly gentleman, ruined by competition in
business, and past beginning life again; and the mother is in a
very precarious state of health.&nbsp; To seek for adopters is
against parental instinct; and besides it might ultimately come
to that, as by the time their schooling is over, in ten or
fifteen years, they would most likely be orphans, and their
willing adopters would be quite welcome to it (<i>sic</i>).&nbsp;
At present the father, in his alarm for the fate of these
creatures, seeks for some that would pay, not to the father, but
to good boarding-schools, for their clothing, keeping, and
tuition, and after school-time to see that they should not
want.&nbsp; Willing benefactors are therefore requested to state
what they would feel inclined to <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>do for each child, by one of the
numbers given at foot, to &lsquo;Alphabet, till called for, at
the Post-office, No. 1 Liverpool-street, Moorfields, E.C.,&rsquo;
enclosing card or addressed envelope to insure correct address,
if a reply should be wished.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another method of applying the photographic art to the
bolstering-up of a spurious begging petition takes a form even
more outrageous than that which was adopted to exhibit the
personal attractions of the distressed six British-born
Protestant children.&nbsp; In the second case it is the portrait
of a handsome young lady, aged about twenty, with a profusion of
lovely hair, and an expression of countenance strikingly artless
and captivating.&nbsp; Accompanying the portrait was a note, as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;I am sure, when you learn
the cause, that you will pardon the liberty I take in addressing
myself to you.&nbsp; I am impelled to do so, not only on account
of your known humanity, but because I have seen you and read in
your face that you will not turn a deaf ear to an appeal frankly
and trustingly made to you.&nbsp; The fact is, my dear sir, I am
absolutely in want of a sixpence to procure a meal.&nbsp; I am
the only child of a father whom <i>misfortune</i> has reduced to
a condition of abject beggary.&nbsp; Mother I have none.&nbsp;
One day I may have an opportunity of narrating to you the
peculiar causes of our present embarrassment.&nbsp; I should feel
it incumbent on me to do so, were I so fortunate as to make you
our creditor for a small sum.&nbsp; Pray spare me the pain of
detailing more minutely the purport of this letter.&nbsp; I am
aware of the boldness of the step I <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>am taking, but the misery of my
wretched father must plead for me in excuse.&nbsp; I enclose my
likeness (taken, alas, in happier times, though scarcely six
months since), so that you may see that I am not a <i>common
beggar</i>.&nbsp; Should my appeal move your compassion towards
me, will you kindly send a note addressed, Adelaide F. T.,
Post-office, &mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gentleman to whom the above artful concoction was
addressed is well known for his philanthropy, and his name
appears frequently in the newspapers.&nbsp; He is an elderly
gentleman, and has grown-up sons and daughters, consequently he
was not a likely person to be trapped by the lovely Adelaide, who
would &ldquo;feel it incumbent on her to seek out and personally
thank her benefactor,&rdquo; in the event of his forwarding to
her a pound or so.&nbsp; But it might have been different, if,
instead of a plain-sailing shrewd man of the world, he had been a
person afflicted with vanity.&nbsp; Here was this poor young
handsome creature, who had seen him and read in his face that
which induced her to make to him such a pitiful avowal of her
poverty&mdash;her <i>peculiar</i> poverty!&nbsp; Why, the story
of the &ldquo;peculiar cause&rdquo; that led to the sudden
downfall of such a family must be worth a pound to listen
to!&nbsp; Was it justifiable to dishonour the promise his face
had assured to the poor young woman?&nbsp; These or similar
reflections might have betrayed the better judgment of a less
experienced person than Mr. L&mdash;.&nbsp; As it was, the artful
note served but to ponder over as one of the latest curiosities
in the begging-letter line; while as for the portrait, it
furnished <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>ample food for moralising on how marvellously deceptive
appearances were&mdash;especially female appearances.</p>
<p>And if this were the end of the story, the good reader, with
all his honest British inclination for giving the accused the
benefit of a doubt, might be tempted to exclaim, &ldquo;And,
after all, who knows but that the appeal to this known
philanthropist might have been genuine?&nbsp; To be sure, the
shape it assumed was one that might well excite the suspicion of
an individual alive to the surpassing cleverness and cunning of
begging impostors; but at the same time there was sufficient of
probability in the application to protect it from the stigma of
impudent fraud.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such readers will be glad to hear
that all doubts on the matter were set at rest, and in the
following singular, and for one party concerned somewhat
unpleasant, manner.&nbsp; The portrait in question fell into the
hands of a relative of Mr. L&mdash;, a gentleman with a hard
heart for begging impostors, and sturdy resolution to put them
down and punish them whenever he encountered them.&nbsp; He was
particularly set against mendicants of the genteel class, and was
very severe in his strictures on the abominable cheat attempted
by &ldquo;Adelaide F. T.&rdquo;&nbsp; One afternoon, while
walking along Oxford-street, lo, the original of the pictured
culprit appeared before him, artlessly and innocently gazing into
a linendraper&rsquo;s window, and accompanied by another
lady.&nbsp; The resemblance between the first lady and the
photograph was so striking as to place her identity beyond a
doubt; yet in order to make <i>quite</i> sure, our friend
withdrew the latter from his <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>pocketbook, and covertly compared it
with the original.&nbsp; It was as certain as that he had eyes in
his head.&nbsp; There was the hair of golden hue massed behind
and raised from the temples; there was the straight nose, the
small winning mouth, and the delicately-rounded chin.&nbsp; The
stern exposer of imposture, however, was not to be moved to mercy
by a pretty face; his course of duty was plain before him, and
stepping up to the lady, he addressed with undisguised severity,
&ldquo;Miss Adelaide T., I believe?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
mistaken, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not at all, madam; a friend of
mine was lately favoured with a letter from you enclosing your
likeness.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was scarcely to be wondered at, that an
expression of terror took possession of the lady&rsquo;s face,
though it was misinterpreted by the gentleman.&nbsp; Thinking
that she was addressed by a drunken man or a maniac, the lady
prudently retreated into the shop the window of which she had
been regarding.&nbsp; More than ever convinced that he was not
mistaken, L&mdash;&rsquo;s friend followed her; and goodness
knows what serious consequences might have ensued, had not the
lady been a known customer of the draper as the daughter of a
gentleman of wealth and station.&nbsp; This, of course, led to an
explanation, and to the most earnest and humble apologies on the
part of the pursuer of imposture.&nbsp; The photograph was
produced, and undoubtedly it was a likeness of the lady.&nbsp;
How it had got into the hands of the designing &ldquo;Adelaide F.
T.&rdquo; no one could tell, but doubtless it was selected on
account of its beauty and prepossessing artlessness.&nbsp; An
endeavour was made to secure the <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>cheats; but from some cause or
another they took alarm, and the decoy letter, addressed
&ldquo;Post-office &mdash;,&rdquo; remained there until it was
returned through the Dead-letter Office.</p>
<p>By the bye, the idea of begging &ldquo;not for myself, but for
another,&rdquo; is a dodge not confined to the epistolary
impostor.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood in which I reside, some
little time since there made her appearance a very fine specimen
of disinterested generosity of the kind in question: a little old
lady dressed in black, with kid-gloves on her hands, and a cloak
soberly trimmed with black crape.&nbsp; She knocked the knock of
a person used to the genteel fingering of a knocker, and might
she be permitted to speak with the lady of the house?&nbsp; It
happened that, at that moment, the gentleman of the house was
going out, and he, hearing the application, suggested that
possibly he might do as well.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, though it was a
trivial matter with which to occupy the attention of a
gentleman.&nbsp; The simple fact was, that the little old lady
was bound on a mission of charity for a poor soul recently left
destitute with nine small children: her aim being the purchase of
a mangle and a few washing-tubs, that the widow might earn an
honourable livelihood for her numerous brood.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
too poor to supply her with <i>all</i> the money out of my own
slender little purse,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;but I have
plenty of leisure, and I think that you will agree with me, sir,
it cannot be employed more worthily.&nbsp; I do not ask for any
large sum on the poor creature&rsquo;s behalf; I only ask one
single penny.&nbsp; I <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>will not take more than a
penny.&nbsp; I put the pence in this little bag, you see, and by
perseverance I trust that I shall soon accomplish my
aim.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the little old lady spoke, she cheerfully
produced from the folds of her cloak a stout linen bag heavy with
copper money, and containing, I should say, at least twelve
shillings.&nbsp; The little old lady&rsquo;s manner was plausible
and smooth, and well calculated to impose on the &ldquo;lady of
the house&rdquo; nine times out of ten.&nbsp; But unfortunately
for her it had been my lot to make the acquaintance of many
strange little old ladies as well as of gentlemen, and I had my
suspicions.&nbsp; I closed the outer door and confronted her on
the mat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but have we not met
before?&rdquo; I asked her.&nbsp; She looked up suddenly and
sharply, with no little alarm on her wizened old face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&mdash;I think not, sir,&rdquo; she faltered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you happen to know a gentleman named Horsford?&rdquo;
was my next inquiry.&nbsp; The little old lady looked still more
embarrassed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not come here to discuss my own
affairs, sir,&rdquo; said she with a sorry affectation of
indignation, &ldquo;nor to answer questions that bear no relation
to my charitable object.&nbsp; I wish you a good-morning,
sir!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that she opened the door, and let
herself out; and descending the steps quickly, trotted up the
street with guilty speed, and turned the corner, and was out of
sight before I could make up my mind what to do with her.</p>
<p>Of advertising beggars there is a large variety.&nbsp; A great
many of them breathe a pious spirit, or rather gasp;&mdash;for it
is seldom that these distressed ones muster <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>courage to
cry out until they have endured their distress even to
death&rsquo;s-door.&nbsp; Not unfrequently the headings or
&ldquo;catch-lines&rdquo; of these printed appeals are culled
from the Bible.&nbsp; Here is one, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Help</span>,
<span class="smcap">or I perish</span>!&rsquo;&mdash;The
advertiser (in his sixty-seventh birthday) was once blessed with
a handsome fortune.&nbsp; Drink&mdash;he confesses it&mdash;has
been the cause of his ruin.&nbsp; He still drinks; not now for
pleasure and in luxury, but to benumb the gnawing of an aroused
conscience.&nbsp; Unless this horrid propensity is checked, the
advertiser feels that he must perish body and soul!&nbsp; Who
will save him?&nbsp; He has two sons in Canada, who are striving
men and total abstainers, and who would receive him with open
arms, could he but raise money enough to purchase some poor
outfit, and to pay for the voyage.&mdash;Address, X.,
Prescott-street, Whitechapel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One cannot help reflecting, that, before contributing towards
a fund to assist the emigration of the aged toper&mdash;who
appears only to have awoke to a sense of his abasement now that
he is stinted of his gin&mdash;he would like to have the opinion
of those striving men, his sons, the total abstainers in
Canada.&nbsp; Possibly they would prefer to honour him at a
distance.&nbsp; According to the ingenious old gentleman&rsquo;s
own showing, he only regards his sons as possible props to keep
him out of a drunkard&rsquo;s grave; and if, fettered under the
weight imposed on them, they sank with their father into the same
dishonourable sepulchre, it would turn out to be money decidedly
ill invested.&nbsp; All this, supposing the appeal to be genuine,
which in all probability it is not.&nbsp; Were <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>it
investigated, the only truthful hit in the appeal would very
likely he found to consist in the three words, &ldquo;he still
drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is another of more recent date, in the emigration
line:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A lady has an opportunity of going to
America, where she could obtain a good situation as governess,
but has not the means of procuring an outfit.&nbsp; She would be
very thankful to anyone who would lend her 10<i>l.</i>, which she
would promise to return with interest at the end of the
year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is cool, but almost feverish compared with the
annexed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Money without
Security</span>!&rsquo;&mdash;Doubtless these mocking words have
struck many readers besides the advertiser.&nbsp; In his
desperate situation he has often put to himself the question, Is
there to be found in this cruel world a good Samaritan who would
confer on a fellow-creature a boon so precious?&nbsp; Is there
one who, blessed with means, can find delight in raising from the
slough of despond a poor wretch stranded on the bank of the black
river of despair?&nbsp; Is there one who will account it cheap by
<i>lending</i> ten pounds, for three months, at twenty-five per
cent interest, to elevate to manly altitude a human creature who,
for want of such a sum, is groaning in the dust?&nbsp; If so, let
him send a Beam of Sunshine to G. S. R., No. 17 Model Lodging
Houses, &mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One cannot but ask the question, is G. S. R. a madman, or
simply an idiot, who can regard it as a &ldquo;joke&rdquo; <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>to waste
five shillings for the privilege of seeing so many lines of empty
rubbish in print?&nbsp; Or, again, are there really any grounds
of five shillingsworth for supposing that amongst the fifty
thousand readers of a daily newspaper one may be met with silly
or eccentric or whimsical enough to entertain G. S. R.&rsquo;s
proposition?&nbsp; It is hard to believe in such a
possibility.&nbsp; Still, there <i>are</i> strange people in the
world; every day furnishes evidence of this fact.&nbsp; Not more
than a month ago it came to light that an old lady residing at
Clapham has for years past been in the habit of paying an
organ-grinder thirty shillings a-week&mdash;a half-sovereign on
the evening of every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday&mdash;to
come and play for half-an-hour under her window.&nbsp; Supposing
a rupture between the lady and her musician, and she had put an
advertisement in the <i>Times</i>&mdash;&ldquo;A lady, a resident
in a quiet suburb, is desirous of engaging with an
organ-grinder.&nbsp; Terms of service, three half-hours per week,
75<i>l.</i> a-year&rdquo;&mdash;who would have regarded it but as
a silly joke?</p>
<p>Here is another begging advertisement of the simple and
affecting type:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">A Widow&rsquo;s Only
Comfort</span>.&mdash;The advertiser begs the kind assistance of
the kind-hearted and benevolent to rescue her pianoforte from the
hands of the broker.&nbsp; It is but a poor old affair (valued
only at 12<i>l.</i>), but it has been her only consolation and
solace since the death of a darling only daughter, whose
instrument it was, and it would break her heart to part with
it.&nbsp; Its music and her prayers should combine to thank any
<a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>one who
was generous enough to restore it to her.&nbsp; Address &mdash;
Colebrook-row.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more instance, and we will have done with the advertising
beggar:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To the Aged and
Unprotected</span>.&mdash;A young man, aged twenty-two,
well-built, good-looking, and of a frank and affectionate
disposition, is desirous of acting the part of a son towards any
aged person or persons who would regard his companionship and
constant devotion as an equivalent for his maintenance and
clothes and support generally.&nbsp; The parents of the
advertiser are both dead, and he has not a relative in the wide
world.&nbsp; Affluence is not aimed at, no more than that degree
of comfort that moderate means insure.&nbsp; Address, O. D.,
&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it is difficult without a struggle to feel an
interest in this young gentleman&rsquo;s welfare, we cannot help
feeling curious to know what success his advertisement brought
him.&nbsp; Is he still a forlorn orphan, wasting his many virtues
and manly attributes on a world that to him is a wilderness; or
has he happily succeeded in captivating &ldquo;some aged person
or persons,&rdquo; and is he at the present time acting the part
of a son towards them, and growing sleek and fat &ldquo;on that
degree of comfort that moderate means insure&rdquo;?&nbsp; Were
his initials J. D. instead of O. D., we might imagine that it was
our ancient friend Jeremiah Diddler turned up once more.&nbsp; O.
D. stand for Old Diddler, but Jeremiah the ancient must be aged
considerably more than twenty-two.&nbsp; We may rest assured,
however, that the advertiser is an offshoot of that venerable
family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> only explanation that can be
offered to the supersensitive reader, who will doubtless
experience a shock of alarm at discovering this page&rsquo;s
heading, is, that it would be simply impossible to treat with any
pretension to completeness of the curses of London without
including it.</p>
<p>Doubtless it is a curse, the mere mention of which, let alone
its investigation, the delicate-minded naturally shrinks
from.&nbsp; But it is a matter for congratulation, perhaps, that
we are not all so delicate-minded.&nbsp; Cowardice is not
unfrequently mistaken for daintiness of nature.&nbsp; It is so
with the subject in question.&nbsp; It is not a pleasant
subject&mdash;very far from it; but that is <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>not a
sufficient excuse for letting it alone.&nbsp; We should never
forget that it is our distaste for meddling with unsavoury
business that does not immediately and personally concern us,
that is the evil-doers&rsquo; armour of impunity.&nbsp; The
monstrous evil in question has grown to its present dimensions
chiefly because we have silently borne with it and let it grow up
in all its lusty rankness under our noses; and rather than pluck
it up by the roots, rather than acknowledge its existence even,
have turned away our heads and inclined our eyes skyward, and
thanked God for the many mercies conferred on us.</p>
<p>And here the writer hastens to confess, not without a tingling
sense of cowardice too, perhaps, that it is not his intention to
expose this terrible canker that preys on the heart and vitals of
society in all its plain and bare repulsiveness.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly it is better at all times to conceal from the public
gaze as much as may be safely hid of the blotches and
plague-spots that afflict the social body; but if to hide them,
and cast white cloths over them, and sprinkle them with
rose-water answers no other purpose (beyond conciliating the
squeamish) than to encourage festering and decay, why then it
becomes a pity that the whole foul matter may not be brought
fairly to board, to be dealt with according to the best of our
sanitary knowledge.</p>
<p>The saving, as well as the chastening, hand of the law should
be held out to the countless host that constitute what is
acknowledged as emphatically <i>the</i> social evil.&nbsp; It has
been urged, that &ldquo;to take this species of <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>vice under
legal regulation is to give it, in the public eye, a species of
legal sanction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ministers from the pulpit have
preached that &ldquo;it can never be right to regulate what it is
wrong to do and wrong to tolerate.&nbsp; To license immorality is
to protect and encourage it.&nbsp; Individuals and houses which
have a place on the public registers naturally regard themselves,
and are regarded by others, as being under the law&rsquo;s
guardianship and authority,&mdash;not, as they ought to be, under
its ban and repression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against this grim and essentially unchristian doctrine, let us
set the argument of a learned and brilliant writer, who some
years since was courageous enough to shed a little wholesome
light on this ugly subject, from the pages of a popular
magazine.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is urged that the &lsquo;tacit
sanction&rsquo; given to vice, by such a <i>recognition</i> of
prostitution as would be involved in a system of supervision,
registration, or license, would be a greater evil than all the
maladies (moral and physical) which now flow from its unchecked
prevalence.&nbsp; But let it be considered that by ignoring we do
not abolish it, we do not even conceal it; it speaks aloud; it
walks abroad; it is a vice as patent and as well-known as
drunkenness; it is already &lsquo;tacitly sanctioned&rsquo; by
the mere fact of its permitted, or connived-at, existence; by the
very circumstance which stares us in the face, that the
legislative and executive authorities, seeing it, deploring it,
yet confess by their inaction their inability to check it, and
their unwillingness to prohibit it, and virtually say to the
unfortunate prostitutes <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>and their frequenters, &lsquo;As
long as you create no public scandal, but throw a decent veil
over your proceedings, we shall not interfere with you, but shall
regard you as an inevitable evil.&rsquo;&nbsp; By an attempt to
regulate and control them, the authorities would confess nothing
more than they already in act acknowledge, viz. their desire to
mitigate an evil which they have discovered their incompetency to
suppress.&nbsp; By prohibiting the practice of prostitution
<i>under certain conditions</i>, they do not legalise or
authorise it under all other conditions; they simply announce
that, <i>under these certain conditions</i>, they feel called
upon promptly to interfere.&nbsp; The legislature does not forbid
drunkenness, knowing that it would be futile to do so: but if a
man, when drunk, is disorderly, pugnacious, or indecent, or in
other mode compromises public comfort or public morals, it steps
forward to arrest and punish him; yet surely by no fair use of
words can it be represented as thereby sanctioning drunkenness
when unaccompanied by indecorous or riotous behaviour, for it
merely declares that in the one case interference falls within
its functions, and that in the other case it does not.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No living writer, however, <i>dare</i> bring the subject
before the public as it should be brought.&nbsp; A penman bolder
than his brethren has but to raise the curtain that conceals the
thousand-and-one abominations that find growth in this
magnificent city of ours, but an inch higher than
&ldquo;decorum&rdquo; permits, than the eyes of outraged modesty
immediately take refuge behind her pocket-handkerchief, and
society at large is aghast at the man&rsquo;s audacity, <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>not to say
&ldquo;indecency.&rdquo;&nbsp; Warned by the fate of such daring
ones, therefore, it shall be the writer&rsquo;s care to avoid all
startling revelations, and the painting of pictures in their real
colours, and to confine himself to plain black-and-white
inoffensive enumerations and descriptions, placing the plain
facts and figures before the reader, that he may deal with them
according to his conscience.</p>
<p>It should incline us to a merciful consideration of the
fallen-woman when we reflect on the monotony of misery her
existence is.&nbsp; She is to herself vile, and she has no other
resource but to flee to the gin-measure, and therein hide herself
from herself.&nbsp; She has no pleasure even.&nbsp; Never was
there made a grimmer joke than that which designates her life a
short and <i>merry</i> one.&nbsp; True, she is found at places
where amusement and wild reckless gaiety is sought; but does she
ever appear amused, or, while she remains sober, recklessly
gay?&nbsp; I am not now alluding to the low prostitute, the
conscienceless wretch who wallows in vice and mire and strong
liquor in a back street of Shadwell, but to the woman of some
breeding and delicacy, the &ldquo;well-dressed&rdquo; creature,
in fact, who does not habitually &ldquo;walk the streets,&rdquo;
but betakes herself to places of popular resort for persons of a
&ldquo;fast&rdquo; turn, and who have money, and are desirous of
expending some of it in &ldquo;seeing life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a
woman would be a frequent visitant at the Argyll Rooms, for
instance; let us turn to Mr. Acton, and see how vastly she enjoys
herself there.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The most striking thing to me about the
place <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>was an upper gallery fringed with this sort of
company.&nbsp; A sprinkling of each class seemed to be there by
assignation, and with no idea of seeking acquaintances.&nbsp; A
number of both sexes, again, were evidently visitors for
distraction&rsquo;s sake alone; the rest were to all intents and
purposes in quest of intrigues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The utter indifference of the stylish loungers in these
shambles contrasted painfully with the anxious countenances of
the many unnoticed women whom the improved manners of the time by
no means permit to make advances.&nbsp; I noticed some very sad
eyes, that gave the lie to laughing lips, as they wandered round
in search of some familiar face in hope of friendly
greeting.&nbsp; There was the sly triumph of here and there a
vixenish hoyden with her leash of patrons about her, and the same
envy, hatred, and malice of the neglected &lsquo;has-been&rsquo;
that some have thought they saw in everyday society.&nbsp; The
glory of the ascendant harlot was no plainer than the
discomfiture of her sister out of luck, whom want of elbow-room
and excitement threw back upon her vacant self.&nbsp; The
affectation of reserve and gentility that pervaded the pens of
that upper region seemed to me but to lay more bare the skeleton;
and I thought, as I circulated among the promiscuous herd to
groundlings, that the sixpenny balcony would better serve to
point a moral than the somewhat more natural, and at all events
far more hilarious, throng about me.&nbsp; As far as regarded
public order, it seemed an admirable arrangement; to the
proprietor of the rooms, profitable; of most of its cribbed and
cabined occupants, a voluntary <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>martyrdom; in all of them, in making
more plain their folly and misfortunes, a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great mass of the general company were on that
occasion males&mdash;young, middle-aged, and old, married and
single, of every shade of rank and respectability; and of these
again the majority seemed to have no other aim than to kill an
hour or two in philosophising, staring at one another and the
women about them, and listening to good music, without a thought
of dancing or intention of ultimate dissipation.&nbsp; A few had
come with companions of our sex to dance, and many had paid their
shillings on speculation only.&nbsp; Some pretty grisettes had
been brought by their lovers to be seen and to see; and once or
twice I thought I saw &lsquo;a sunbeam that had lost its
way,&rsquo; where a modest young girl was being paraded by a
foolish swain, or indoctrinated into the charms of town by a
designing scamp.&nbsp; There were plenty of dancers, and the
casual polka was often enough, by mutual consent, the beginning
and end of the acquaintance.&nbsp; There was little appearance of
refreshment or solicitation, and none whatever of ill-behaviour
or drunkenness.&nbsp; It was clear that two rills of population
had met in Windmill-street&mdash;one idle and vicious by
profession or inclination, the other idle for a few hours on
compulsion.&nbsp; Between them there was little
amalgamation.&nbsp; A few dozen couples of the former, had there
been no casino, would have concocted their amours in the
thoroughfares; the crowd who formed the other seemed to seek the
place with no definite views beyond light music and
shelter.&nbsp; <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>Many, whose thorough British gravity was proof against
more than all the meretriciousness of the assembly, would, I
fancy, have been there had it been confined to males only.&nbsp;
I am convinced they were open to neither flirtation nor
temptation, and I know enough of my countryman&rsquo;s general
taste to affirm that they ran little hazard of the
latter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Cremorne Gardens &ldquo;in the season&rdquo; would seem
a likely place to seek the siren devoted to a life mirthful
though brief.&nbsp; Let us again accompany Mr. Acton.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As calico and merry respectability tailed
off eastward by penny steamers, the setting sun brought westward
hansoms freighted with demure immorality in silk and fine
linen.&nbsp; By about ten o&rsquo;clock age and
innocence&mdash;of whom there had been much in the place that
day&mdash;had retired, weary of amusement, leaving the massive
elms, the grass-plots, and the geranium-beds, the kiosks,
temples, &lsquo;monster platforms,&rsquo; and &lsquo;crystal
circle&rsquo; of Cremorne to flicker in the thousand gaslights
there for the gratification of the dancing public only.&nbsp; On
and around that platform waltzed, strolled, and fed some thousand
souls, perhaps seven hundred of them men of the upper and middle
class, the remainder prostitutes more or less
<i>prononc&eacute;es</i>.&nbsp; I suppose that a hundred
couples&mdash;partly old acquaintances, part
improvised&mdash;were engaged in dancing and other amusements,
and the rest of the society, myself included, circulated
listlessly about the garden, and enjoyed in a grim kind of way
the &lsquo;selection&rsquo; from some favourite opera and the
cool night breeze from the river.</p>
<p><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&ldquo;The extent of disillusion he has purchased in
this world comes forcibly home to the middle-aged man who in such
a scene attempts to fathom former faith and ancient joys, and
perhaps even vainly to fancy he might by some possibility begin
again.&nbsp; I saw scores, nay hundreds, about me in the same
position as myself.&nbsp; We were there, and some of us, I feel
sure, hardly knew why; but being there, and it being obviously
impossible to enjoy the place after the manner of youth, it was
necessary, I suppose, to chew the cud of sweet and bitter
fancies; and then so little pleasure came, that the Britannic
solidity waxed solider than ever even in a garden full of music
and dancing, and so an almost mute procession, not of joyous
revellers, but thoughtful careworn men and women, paced round and
round the platform as on a horizontal treadmill.&nbsp; There was
now and then a bare recognition between passers-by: they seemed
to touch and go like ants in the hurry of business.&nbsp; I do
not imagine for a moment they could have been aware that a
self-appointed inspector was among them; but, had they known it
never so well, the intercourse of the sexes could hardly have
been more reserved&mdash;<i>as a general rule</i>, be it always
understood.&nbsp; For my part I was occupied, when the first
chill of change was shaken off, in quest of noise, disorder,
debauchery, and bad manners.&nbsp; Hopeless task!&nbsp; The
picnic at Burnham Beeches, that showed no more life and merriment
than Cremorne on the night and time above mentioned, would be a
failure indeed, unless the company were antiquarians or
undertakers.&nbsp; A jolly burst of laughter now and then <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>came
bounding through the crowd that fringed the dancing-floor and
roved about the adjacent sheds in search of company; but that
gone by, you heard very plainly the sigh of the poplar, the
surging gossip of the tulip-tree, and the plash of the little
embowered fountain that served two plaster children for an
endless shower-bath.&nbsp; The function of the very band appeared
to be to drown not noise, but stillness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without entering into repulsive detail, I will endeavour to
give the reader some idea of the different methods under which
the nefarious business is conducted.&nbsp; The &ldquo;houses of
ill-fame&rdquo; differ as widely in the extent and quality of
their dealings as the houses of honesty and fair commerce.&nbsp;
There are houses of &ldquo;ill-fame&rdquo; in the most
fashionable quarters of the town, just as there are in
Wapping&mdash;houses that are let and sub-let until they reach a
rental as high as three and four hundred pounds a-year.&nbsp; It
is not in those aristocratic dens of infamy, however, that women
suffer most; none but the most costly wares are on sale at such
establishments, and it is to the interest <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>of the
hucksters who traffic in them to deal with them delicately as
circumstances will permit, to humour and coax and caress them as
pet animals are coaxed and humoured.&nbsp; Nor would the
creatures themselves tolerate anything in the shape of brutal
treatment at the hands of those who harbour them.&nbsp; They
&ldquo;know their value,&rdquo; and as a rule are exacting,
imperious, and insolent towards their
&ldquo;landlords.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unlike their sister unfortunates
lower sunk in iniquity, they would experience no difficulty in
procuring new &ldquo;lodgings.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doors of a
hundred establishments such as that she now honours with
residence are open to her.&nbsp; With a handsome face and a full
purse, the whole of the devilish crew of brothel-keepers are her
slaves, her fawning, cringing slaves, ready to lick the dust from
her shoes, so that she pays regularly her rent of ten guineas
a-week, and fails not to induce her &ldquo;friends&rdquo; to
drink champagne at a guinea a bottle.</p>
<p>Possibly the gay lady may come to the &ldquo;bitter end&rdquo;
some day, but at present, except from the moral point of view,
she is not an object for commiseration.&nbsp; She at least has
all that she deliberately bargains for&mdash;fine clothes, rich
food, plenty of money, a carriage to ride in, the slave-like
obedience of her &ldquo;inferiors,&rdquo; and the fulsome
adulation of those who deal with her for her worth.&nbsp; Very
often (though under the circumstances it is doubtful if from any
aspect this is an advantage) she finds a fool with money who is
willing to marry her; but whether she is content to accept the
decent change, and to abide by it, of course depends <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>on her
nature.&nbsp; Whether her husband adheres to his rash bargain is
a question that time only can solve.&nbsp; He at least, if he be
a vicious man as well as a fool, may argue that she will be
little the worse than when he found her if he leaves her; while
possibly she may gather consolation from the same method of
argument.</p>
<p>Anyway, she has a long way to descend before she may be
branded as &ldquo;common.&rdquo;&nbsp; At present she is not even
included in the police-returns.&nbsp; Any blue-coated guardian of
the peace, in humble hope of earning a sixpence, would be only
too eager to touch his hat to her and open her carriage-door
to-morrow, and that even at the door of her genteel residence,
which is in a neighbourhood much too respectable to permit it to
be stigmatised as a &ldquo;brothel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police-report just quoted specifies that the 8600
prostitutes infesting the metropolis include 921 well-dressed and
living in houses of ill-fame.&nbsp; This on the face of it,
however, is significant of how very little the police really know
of the matter they venture to report on.&nbsp; The women here
alluded to are of the unobtrusive and orderly sort, the mainstay
of whose occupation is to pass as respectable persons.&nbsp; They
would be the last to resort for permanent lodging at houses whose
fame was so ill that the greenest policeman on beat could point
them out.&nbsp; It is altogether too hard to fasten the
imputation of infamous on the holders of the houses in which this
class of unfortunate seeks lodging.&nbsp; In very many cases the
women are actuated by a twofold reason in gaining admission to <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>the house
of a householder who does not suspect her real character.&nbsp;
In the first place, and as already stated, she wishes to pass in
the immediate neighbourhood as respectable; and in the next place
she not unnaturally seeks to evade payment of the monstrously
high rate of rent that the common brothel-keeper would impose on
her.&nbsp; Moreover, the peculiar branch of the terrible business
she essays prospers under such management, where it would not if
it were otherwise conducted.&nbsp; As a body, the women in
question must be regarded as human creatures who have not gone
<i>altogether</i> to the bad; and though in grim truth it may be
in the highest degree absurd for anyone to cast herself
deliberately into a sea of abomination, and then to affect a
mincing manner of seriousness, much allowance should be made for
the possibility that the fatal leap was not taken with cool
forethought, or that the urging to it was due to some devilish
genius whom there was no resisting.&nbsp; Anyhow, it would be
hard on them, poor wretches, to compel them to give up their
endeavours to conceal their degradation if, apart from mercenary
motives, they are heartily desirous of concealing it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A vast proportion of those who, after
passing through the career of kept mistresses, ultimately come
upon the town, fall in the first instance from a mere
exaggeration and perversion of one of the best qualities of a
woman&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; They yield to desires in which they do
not share, from a weak generosity which cannot refuse anything to
the passionate entreaties of the <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>man they love.&nbsp; There is in the
warm fond heart of woman a strange and sublime unselfishness,
which men too commonly discover only to profit by,&mdash;a
positive love of self-sacrifice, an active, so to speak, an
<i>aggressive</i> desire to show their affection by giving up to
those who have won it something they hold very dear.&nbsp; It is
an unreasoning and dangerous yearning of the spirit, precisely
analogous to that which prompts the surrenders and self-tortures
of the religious devotee.&nbsp; Both seek to prove their devotion
to the idol they have enshrined, by casting down before his altar
their richest and most cherished treasures.&nbsp; This is no
romantic or over-coloured picture; those who deem it so have not
known the better portion of the sex, or do not deserve to have
known them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would soften the hearts of many, and hold the hands of
those who would break down the bridge behind the sinner, could
they know the awful misery that frequently attends the life of a
fallen woman.&nbsp; The 921 questionably quoted as &ldquo;well
dressed, and living in houses of ill-fame,&rdquo; do not at all
represent the horrors of the social evil in all its ghastly
integrity.&nbsp; Such women are at least free to a certain extent
to act as they please.&nbsp; No restriction is set on their
movements; they may remain at home or go abroad, dress as they
please, and expend their miserable gains according to their
fancy.&nbsp; But they have sisters in misfortune to whom the
smallest of these privileges is denied.&nbsp; They are to be
found amongst the unhappy 2216 who are described as &ldquo;well
dressed, and walking the streets.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>Unlike the
gay lady, who makes her downynest in the topmost branches of the
deadly upas-tree, and is altogether above suspicion or vulgar
reproach, this poor wretch is without a single possession in the
wide world.&nbsp; She is but one of a thousand walking the
streets of London, the most cruelly used and oppressed of all the
great family to which they own relationship.&nbsp; They are bound
hand and foot to the harpies who are their keepers.&nbsp; They
are infinitely worse off than the female slaves on a
nigger-plantation, for they at least may claim as their own the
rags they wear, as well as a share of the miserable hut common to
the gang after working-hours.&nbsp; But these slaves of the
London pavement may boast of neither soul nor body, nor the gaudy
skirts and laces and ribbons with which they are festooned.&nbsp;
They belong utterly and entirely to the devil in human shape who
owns the den that the wretched harlot learns to call her
&ldquo;home.&rdquo;&nbsp; You would never dream of the deplorable
depth of her destitution, if you met her in her gay attire.&nbsp;
Splendid from her tasselled boots to the full-blown and flowery
hat or bonnet that crowns her guilty head, she is absolutely
poorer than the meanest beggar that ever whined for a crust.</p>
<p>These women are known as &ldquo;dress lodgers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They are poor wretches who somehow or another are reduced to the
lowest depths of destitution.&nbsp; Sometimes illness is the
cause.&nbsp; Sometimes, if a girl gets into a bad house, and is
as yet too new to the horrible business to conform without
remonstrance to the scandalous extortions practised by the
brothel-keeper, she is &ldquo;broken down <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>and brought
to it&rdquo; by design and scheming.&nbsp; A girl not long since
confided to a clergyman friend of mine the following shocking
story.&nbsp; Rendered desperate by the threats of the wretch who
owned her, she applied to him for advice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was bad
enough before, I don&rsquo;t deny it; but I wasn&rsquo;t a
thief.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t been used to their ways for more than
a month, and had a good box of clothes and a silver watch and
gold chain, when I went to lodge there, and it was all very well
while I spent my money like a fool, bought gin, and treated
&rsquo;em all round; but when I wouldn&rsquo;t stand it any
longer, and told her (the brothel-keeper) plain that I would pay
her the rent and no more (nine shillings a-week for a small back
room), she swore that she&rsquo;d break me down, and &lsquo;bring
me to her weight.&rsquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know that at the
time; I didn&rsquo;t hear of it till afterwards.&nbsp; She was
fair enough to my face, and begged me not to leave her,
flattering me, and telling me she would be ruined when her
customers found out that the prettiest woman had left her.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s how she quieted me, till one day, when I came home,
she accused me of robbing a gentleman the night before of a
diamond shirt-pin, and there was a fellow there who said he was a
&lsquo;detective,&rsquo; and though my box was locked he had
opened it before I came home, and swore that he had found the
pin, which he showed me.&nbsp; It was all a lie.&nbsp; I had been
with a gentleman the night before, but he wore a scarf with a
ring to it; that I could swear to.&nbsp; But it was no use saying
anything; I was the thief, they said, and I was to be taken into
custody.&nbsp; What was I to do?&nbsp; I begged of the <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>detective
not to take me; I implored Mother H&mdash; to intercede for me,
and she pretended to.&nbsp; She went into another room with the
detective, and then she came back and told me that the man would
take ten pounds down to hush it up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen that
man since; he is a &lsquo;bully&rsquo; at a bad house in the
Waterloo-road, but I truly believed that he was a private-clothes
policeman, as he said he was.&nbsp; Of course I didn&rsquo;t have
ten pounds, nor ten shillings hardly; but Mother H&mdash; said
that she would lend the money &lsquo;on security;&rsquo; and I
made over to her&mdash;sold to her, in fact&mdash;in writing,
every scrap of clothes that I had in my box and on my back.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have them too, Meg,&rsquo; Mother H&mdash;
said, &lsquo;and then you&rsquo;re safe not to run
away.&rsquo;&nbsp; I made over to her the box as well, and my
watch, and gave her an I O U besides for five pounds, and then
she &lsquo;squared&rsquo; it with the detective, and he went
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I came to be a &lsquo;dress
lodger.&rsquo;&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t wait long before she opened
her mind to me.&nbsp; She up and told me that very night:
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got a new landlady now, my fine madam,&rsquo;
said she; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve got to <i>work</i> for your living
now; to work for <i>me</i>, d&rsquo;ye understand?&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t work&mdash;can&rsquo;t earn a penny without you dress
spicy, and every rag you&rsquo;ve got on is <i>mine</i>; and if
you say one wry word, I&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em off and bundle
you out.&rsquo;&nbsp; So what could I do or say?&rdquo; continued
the poor wretch, tears streaming down her really handsome face;
&ldquo;all the girls there were &lsquo;dress lodgers,&rsquo; and
I believe that they were glad to see me brought to their
level.&nbsp; They only laughed to hear Mother H&mdash; go on <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>so.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been a &lsquo;dress lodger&rsquo; ever since, not
being able to get a shilling for myself, for she takes away all I
get, and besides is always threatening to strip me and turn me
out, and to sue me for the five pounds I owe her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My informant asked her, &ldquo;How does she exercise this
amount of control over you?&nbsp; She is not always with you; you
leave her house to walk the streets, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do, but not alone.&nbsp; Dress lodgers are never
allowed to do that, sir.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t been one long, but
long enough to find that out.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s always a
&lsquo;watcher.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sometimes it&rsquo;s a
woman&mdash;an old woman, who isn&rsquo;t fit for anything
else&mdash;but in general it&rsquo;s a man.&nbsp; He watches you
always, walking behind you, or on the opposite side of the
way.&nbsp; He never loses sight of you, never fear.&nbsp; You
daren&rsquo;t so much as go into a public for a drain of gin but
he is in after you in a minute, and must have his glass too,
though he isn&rsquo;t allowed to do it&mdash;to have the gin, I
mean; and <i>you</i> ain&rsquo;t allowed it either, not a drop,
if the old woman knows it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re supposed to walk
about and look for your living, and the watcher is supposed to
see that you do do it&mdash;to take care that you look sharp, and
above all that you don&rsquo;t take customers anywhere but
<i>home</i>.&nbsp; And what do you get for it all?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re half fed, and bullied day and night, and threatened
to be stripped and turned out; and when you&rsquo;re at home, the
watcher is generally hanging about, and he&rsquo;ll
&lsquo;down&rsquo; you with a &lsquo;one&rsquo;r&rsquo; in the
back or side (he won&rsquo;t hit you in the face, for fear of
spoiling it) if Mother H&mdash; only gives him the wink, though
perhaps <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>you&rsquo;ve risked getting into trouble, and stood
many a glass of gin to him the night before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult, indeed, to imagine a human creature more
deplorably circumstanced than the one whose sad story is above
narrated, and who is only &ldquo;one of a thousand.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are those of the sisterhood who appear in a more hideous
shape, as, for instance, the horde of human tigresses who swarm
in the pestilent dens by the riverside at Ratcliff and
Shadwell.&nbsp; These may have fallen lower in depravity, indeed
they are herded in the very mud and ooze of it, but they do not
<i>suffer</i> as the gaily-bedizened &ldquo;dress lodger&rdquo;
does.&nbsp; They are almost past human feeling.&nbsp; Except when
they are ill and in hospital, they are never sober.&nbsp; As soon
as her eyes are open in the morning, the she-creature of
&ldquo;Tiger Bay&rdquo; seeks to cool her parched mouth out of
the gin-bottle; and &ldquo;&mdash; your eyes, let us have some
more gin!&rdquo; is the prayer she nightly utters before she
staggers to her straw, to snore like the worse than pig she
is.</p>
<p>Soldiers&rsquo; women are different from sailors&rsquo;
women.&nbsp; As a rule, they are much more decent in appearance,
and they are insured against habits of bestial intoxication by
the slender resources of the men on whose bounty they
depend.&nbsp; It is not possible to dip very deeply into the
wine-cup or even the porter-pot on an income of about
fourpence-halfpenny per diem, and it painfully illustrates what a
wretched trade prostitution may become that it is driven even to
the barracks.</p>
<p>Beyond the barracks; out on to the wild bleak common, <a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>where,
winter and summer, the military tents are pitched.</p>
<p>A year or so since there appeared in the pages of the <i>Pall
Mall Gazette</i> three graphic and astounding letters concerning
the dreadful condition of a colony of women who
&ldquo;squatted&rdquo; amongst the furze of Curragh Common, and
subsisted on such miserable wage as the soldiers there quartered
could afford to pay them.&nbsp; These creatures are known in and
about the great military camp and its neighbourhood as
&ldquo;wrens.&rdquo;&nbsp; They do not live in houses, or even
huts, but build for themselves &ldquo;nests&rdquo; in the
bush.&nbsp; To quote the words of the writer in question, these
nests &ldquo;have an interior space of about nine feet long by
seven feet broad; and the roof is not more than four and a half
feet from the ground.&nbsp; You crouch into them as beasts crouch
into cover, and there is no standing upright till you crawl out
again.&nbsp; They are rough misshapen domes of furze, like big
rude birds&rsquo;-nests, compacted of harsh branches, and turned
topsy-turvy upon the ground.&nbsp; The walls are some twenty
inches thick, and they do get pretty well compacted&mdash;much
more than would be imagined.&nbsp; There is no chimney&mdash;not
even a hole in the roof, which generally slopes forward.&nbsp;
The smoke of the turf-fire which burns on the floor of the hut
has to pass out at the door when the wind is favourable, and to
reek slowly through the crannied walls when it is not.&nbsp; The
door is a narrow opening, nearly the height of the
structure&mdash;a slit in it, kept open by two rude posts, which
also serve to support the roof.&nbsp; To keep <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>it down and
secure from the winds that drive over the Curragh so furiously,
sods of earth are placed on top, here and there, with a piece of
corrugated iron (much used in the camp, apparently&mdash;I saw
many old and waste pieces lying about) as an additional
protection from rain.&nbsp; Sometimes a piece of this iron is
placed in the longitudinal slit aforesaid, and then you have a
door as well as a doorway.&nbsp; Flooring there is none of any
kind whatever, nor any attempt to make the den snugger by
burrowing down into the bosom of the earth.&nbsp; The process of
construction seems to be to clear the turf from the surface of
the plain to the required space, to cut down some bushes for
building material, and to call in a friendly soldier or two to
rear the walls by the simple process of piling and
trampling.&nbsp; When the nest is newly made, as that one was
which I first examined, and if you happen to view it on a hot
day, no doubt it seems tolerably snug shelter.&nbsp; A sportsman
might lie there for a night or two without detriment to his
health or his moral nature.&nbsp; But all the nests are not newly
made; and if the sun shines on the Curragh, bitter winds drive
across it, with swamping rains for days and weeks together, and
miles of snow-covered plain sometimes lie between this wretched
colony of abandoned women and the nearest town.&nbsp; Wind and
rain are their worst enemies (unless we reckon-in mankind) and
play &lsquo;old gooseberry&rsquo; with the bush-dwellings.&nbsp;
The beating of the one and the pelting of the other soon destroy
their bowery summer aspect.&nbsp; They get crazy, they <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>fall toward
this side and that, they shrink in and down upon the outcast
wretches that huddle in them, and the doorposts don&rsquo;t keep
the roof up, and the clods don&rsquo;t keep it down.&nbsp; The
nest is nothing but a furzy hole, such as, for comfort, any
wild-beast may match anywhere, leaving cleanliness out of the
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In each of these wretched lairs, the writer&mdash;who, be it
borne in mind, was an eye-witness of what he describes&mdash;goes
on to inform us, companies of these awful &ldquo;birds,&rdquo;
varying in number from three to six, eat, drink, sleep, cook, and
receive company.&nbsp; As regards the furniture and domestic
utensils with which each hut is provided, &ldquo;the most
important piece of furniture was a wooden shelf running along the
back of the nest, and propped on sticks driven into the earthen
floor.&nbsp; Some mugs, some plates, some cups and saucers, a
candlestick; two or three old knives and forks, battered and
rusty; a few dull and dinted spoons; a teapot (this being rather
a rich establishment), and several other articles of a like
character, were displayed upon the shelf; and a grateful sight it
was.&nbsp; I declare I was most thankful for the cups and
saucers; and as for the teapot, it looked like an ark of
redemption in crockery-ware.&nbsp; If they were not&mdash;as I
told myself when my eyes first rested on them&mdash;the only
human-looking things in the place, they did give one a
comfortable assurance that these wretched and desperate outcasts
had not absolutely broken with the common forms and habits of
civilised life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beneath it was heaped an armful of musty
straw, <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>originally smuggled in from the camp stables: this,
drawn out and shaken upon the earth, was the common bed.&nbsp; A
rough wooden box, such as candles are packed in, stood in a
corner; one or two saucepans, and a horrid old tea-kettle, which
had all the look of a beldame punished by drink, were disposed in
various nooks in the furzy walls; a frying-pan was stuck into
them by the handle, in company with a crooked stick of iron used
as a poker; and&mdash;undoubtedly <i>that</i> was there&mdash;a
cheap little looking-glass was stuck near the roof.&nbsp; These
things formed the whole furniture and appointments of the nest,
if we exclude a petticoat or so hung up at intervals.&nbsp; There
was not a stool in the place; and as for anything in the shape of
a table, there was not room even for the idea of such a
thing.&nbsp; Except for the cups and saucers, I doubt whether any
Australian native habitation is more savage or more destitute:
<i>he</i> can get an old saucepan or two, and knows how to spread
a little straw on the ground.&nbsp; Nor were any of the other
nests (and I believe I looked into them all) better or
differently furnished.&nbsp; The only difference was in the
quantity of crockery.&nbsp; In every one the candle-box was to be
found.&nbsp; I discovered that it was the receptacle of those
little personal ornaments and cherished trifles which women, in
every grade of life, hoard with a sort of animal instinct.&nbsp;
In every one an upturned saucepan was used for a seat, when
squatting on the earth became too tiresome.&nbsp; In all, the
practice is to sleep with your head under the shelf (thus gaining
some additional protection from the wind) <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>and your
feet to the turf-fire, which is kept burning all night near the
doorway.&nbsp; Here the use of the perforated saucepan becomes
apparent.&nbsp; It is placed over the burning turf when the wrens
dispose themselves to rest, and as there is no want of air in
these dwellings, the turf burns well and brightly under the
protecting pot.&nbsp; Another remembrance of a decent life is
seen in the fact, that the women always undress themselves to
sleep upon their handful of straw, their day-clothes serving to
cover them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;wrens&rdquo; themselves are described as being
almost all young, and all, without an exception, Irish.&nbsp;
They range from seventeen to twenty-five years old, and almost
all come out of cabins in country places.&nbsp; Occasionally a
delicate-looking &ldquo;wren&rdquo; may be met, but as a rule
they are sturdy, fine-limbed women, full of health and strength;
many are good-looking.&nbsp; In their style of dress, no less
than undress, they are peculiar.&nbsp; &ldquo;All day they lounge
in a half-naked state, clothed simply in one frieze petticoat,
and another, equally foul, cast loosely over then shoulders;
though, towards evening, they put on the decent attire of the
first girl I met there.&nbsp; These bettermost clothes are kept
bright and clean enough; the frequency with which they are seen
displayed on the bushes to dry, shows how often they are washed,
and how well.&nbsp; These observations apply to the cotton gown,
the stockings, the white petticoat alone; frieze and flannel
never know anything of soap-and-water at all, apparently.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;Curragh-petticoat&rsquo; is familiarly known for miles
<a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>and
miles round; its peculiarity seems to be that it is starched, but
not ironed.&nbsp; The difference in the appearance of these poor
wretches when the gown and petticoat are donned, and when they
are taken off again (that is to say, the moment they come back
from the &lsquo;hunting-grounds&rsquo;), answers precisely to
their language and demeanour when sober and when
tipsy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The communistic principle governs each
&ldquo;nest;&rdquo; and share-and-share alike is the rule
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;None of the women have any money of their
own; what each company get is thrown into a common purse, and the
nest is provisioned out of it.&nbsp; What they get is little
indeed: a few halfpence turned out of one pocket and another when
the clean starched frocks are thrown off at night, make up a
daily income just enough to keep body and soul
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inquiry careful and judicious disclosed to the daring literary
investigator that the &ldquo;wrens&rdquo; take it in turns to do
the marketing and keep house while their sisters are abroad
&ldquo;on business.&rdquo;&nbsp; As need not be mentioned, it is
the youngest and best-looking women who engage in the
money-getting branch.&nbsp; Considering how severe are their
privations, and the unceasing life of wretchedness they lead, it
is not without surprise that we hear that many of the
&ldquo;wrens&rdquo; have occupied the ground they still squat on
during the past eight or nine years.&nbsp; &ldquo;I asked one of
these older birds how they contrived their sleeping-accommodation
before &lsquo;nests&rsquo; were invented.&nbsp; Said she,
&lsquo;We&rsquo;d pick the biggest little bush we could find, and
lay under it, turnin&rsquo; wid the <a name="page298"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 298</span>wind.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Shifting
round the bush as the wind shifted?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thrue for
ye.&nbsp; And sometimes we&rsquo;d wake wid the snow covering us,
and maybe soaked wid rain.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And how did you
dry your clothes?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We jist waited for a fine
day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above and much more information concerning the habits and
customs of these bushwomen of the Curragh was obtained in the
daytime; but this was not enough for the plucky <i>Pall-Mall</i>
adventurer.&nbsp; He was well aware that the wren was a
night-bird, and could only be seen in her true colours by
candle-glimmer within her nest, or by the light of the stars or
moon while abroad hunting for prey.&nbsp; Setting out after dark,
our friend made his way across the common towards the nests he
had visited the day before, and particularly to one known as No.
2 nest, the inmates of which had shown themselves very civil and
obliging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I approached it,&rdquo; says the writer, &ldquo;I
saw but one wretched figure alone.&nbsp; Crouched near the
glowing turf, with her head resting upon her hands, was a woman
whose age I could scarcely guess at, though I think, by the
masses of black hair that fell forward upon her hands and
backward over her bare shoulders, that she must have been
young.&nbsp; She was apparently dozing, and taking no heed of the
pranks of the frisky little curly-headed boy whom I have made
mention of before; he was playing on the floor.&nbsp; When I
announced myself by rapping on the bit of corrugated iron which
stood across the bottom of the doorway, the woman started in
something like fright; but she knew <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>me at a second glance, and in I
went.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put back the iron, if ye plaze,&rsquo; said
the wren as I entered; &lsquo;the wind&rsquo;s blowing this way
to-night, bad luck to it!&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; I wanted to know how
my wretched companion in this lonely, windy, comfortless hovel,
came from being a woman to be turned into a wren.&nbsp; The story
began with &lsquo;no father nor mother,&rsquo; an aunt who kept a
whisky-store in Cork, an artilleryman who came to the
whisky-store and saw and seduced the girl.&nbsp; By and by his
regiment was ordered to the Curragh.&nbsp; The girl followed him,
being then with child.&nbsp; &lsquo;He blamed me for following
him,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;d have nothing to do
with me.&nbsp; He told me to come here, and do like other women
did.&nbsp; And what could I do?&nbsp; My child was born here, in
this very place; and glad I was of the shelter, and glad I was
when the child died&mdash;thank the blessed Mary!&nbsp; What
could I do with a child?&nbsp; His father was sent away from
here, and a good riddance.&nbsp; He used me very
bad.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a minute&rsquo;s silence the woman
continued, a good deal to my surprise, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show you
the likeness of a betther man, far away, one that never said a
cross word to me&mdash;blessed&rsquo;s the ground he treads
upon!&rsquo;&nbsp; And fumbling in the pocket of her too scanty
and dingy petticoat, she produced a photographic portrait of a
soldier, enclosed in half-a-dozen greasy letters.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a bandsman, sir, and a handsome man he is; and
I believe he likes me too.&nbsp; But they have sent him to Malta
for six years; I&rsquo;ll never see my darlint
again.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then this poor wretch, who was half
crying as she <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>spoke, told me how she had walked to Dublin to see him
just before he sailed, &lsquo;because the poor craythur wanted to
see me onst more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this woman, so strangely compounded, I learned
that she had suffered so much privation last winter, that she had
made up her mind not to stay in the bush another such a
season.&nbsp; &lsquo;At the first fall of snow I&rsquo;ll go to
the workhouse, that I will!&rsquo; she said in the tone of one
who says that in such an event he is determined to cut his
throat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, would you belave it, sir?&mdash;last
winter the snow would be up as high as our little house, and we
had to cut a path through it to the min, or we&rsquo;d been
ruined intirely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . .&nbsp; Presently the report of a gun was
heard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gunfire!&rsquo; cried my companion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They&rsquo;ll be back soon now, and I hope it&rsquo;s not
drunk they are.&rsquo;&nbsp; I went out to listen.&nbsp; All was
dead quiet, and nothing was to be seen but the lights in the
various bushes, till suddenly a blaze broke out at a
distance.&nbsp; Some dry furze had been fired by some of the
soldiers wandering on the common, and in search of whom the
picket presently came round, peeping into every bush.&nbsp;
Presently the sound of distant voices was heard; it came nearer
and nearer, and its shrillness and confusion made it known to me
that it was indeed a party of returning wrens, far from
sober.&nbsp; They were, in fact, mad drunk; and the sound of
their voices as they came on through the dense darkness,
screaming obscene sounds broken by bursts of horrible laughter,
with now and then a rattling volley of oaths which told that
fighting was going on, was staggering.&nbsp; <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>I confess I
now felt uncomfortable.&nbsp; I had only seen the wren sober, or
getting sober; what she might be in that raging state of
drunkenness I had yet to find out, and the discovery threatened
to be very unpleasant.&nbsp; The noise came nearer, and was more
shocking because you could disentangle the voices and track each
through its own course of swearing, or of obscene singing and
shouting, or of dreadful threats, which dealt in detail with
every part of the human frame.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is this your
lot?&rsquo; I asked my companion with some apprehension, as at
length the shameful crew burst out of the darkness.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Some of &rsquo;em, I think.&rsquo;&nbsp; But no, they
passed on; such a spectacle as made me tremble.&nbsp; I felt like
a man respited when the last woman went staggering by.&nbsp;
Again voices were heard, this time proceeding from the women
belonging to the bush where I was spending such an uncomfortable
evening.&nbsp; Five in all,&mdash;two tipsy and three
comparatively sober,&mdash;they soon presented themselves at the
door; one of them was Billy&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; At the sound of
her voice the child woke up and cried for her.&nbsp; She was the
most forbidding-looking creature in the whole place; but she
hastened to divest herself outside of her crinoline and the rest
of her walking attire (nearly all she had on), and came in and
nursed the boy very tenderly.&nbsp; The other wrens also took off
gown and petticoat, and folding them up, made seats of them
within the nest.&nbsp; Then came the important inquiry from the
watching wren, &lsquo;What luck have you had?&rsquo; to which the
answer was, &lsquo;Middling.&rsquo;&nbsp; Without the least
scruple they counted up what they had got <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>amongst
them&mdash;a poor account.&nbsp; It was enough to make a
man&rsquo;s heart bleed to hear the details, and to see the
actual money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to continue my observations a little later in
a way agreeable to those wretched outcasts, I proposed to
&lsquo;stand supper,&rsquo; a proposition which was joyfully
received, of course.&nbsp; Late as it was, away went one of the
wrens to get supper, presently returning with a loaf, some bacon,
some tea, some sugar, a little milk, and a can of water.&nbsp;
The women brought all these things in such modest quantities that
my treat cost no more (I got my change, and I remember the
precise sum) than two shillings and eightpence-halfpenny.&nbsp;
The frying-pan was put in requisition, and there seemed some
prospect of a &lsquo;jolly night&rsquo; for my more sober nest of
wrens.&nbsp; One of them began to sing&mdash;not a pretty song;
but presently she stopped to listen to the ravings of a
strong-voiced vixen in an adjoining bush.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
Kate,&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;and she&rsquo;s got the drink in
her&mdash;the devil that she is.&rsquo;&nbsp; I then heard that
this was a woman of such ferocity when drunk that the whole
colony was in terror of her.&nbsp; One of the women near me
showed me her face, torn that very night by the virago&rsquo;s
nails, and a finger almost bitten through.&nbsp; As long as the
voice of the formidable creature was heard, everyone was silent
in No. 2 nest&mdash;silent out of fear that she would presently
appear amongst them.&nbsp; Her voice ceased: again a song was
commenced; then the frying-pan began to hiss; and that sound it
was, perhaps, that brought the dreaded virago down upon us.&nbsp;
<a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>She was
heard coming from her own bush, raging as she came.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My God, there she is!&rsquo; one of the women
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s coming here; and if she sees
you she&rsquo;ll tear every rag from your back!&rsquo;&nbsp; The
next moment the fierce creature burst into our bush, a stalwart
woman full five feet ten inches high, absolutely mad with
drink.&nbsp; Her hair was streaming down her back; she had
scarcely a rag of clothing on; and the fearful figure made at me
with a large jug, intended to be smashed upon my skull.&nbsp; I
declare her dreadful figure appalled me.&nbsp; I was so
wonder-stricken, that I believe she might have knocked me on the
head without resistance; but, quick as lightning, one of the
women got before me, spreading out her petticoat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Get out of it!&rsquo; she shouted in terror;
&lsquo;run!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so I did.&nbsp; Covered by this
friendly and grateful wren, I passed out of the nest, and made my
way homeward in the darkness.&nbsp; One of the girls stepped out
to show me the way.&nbsp; I parted from her a few yards from the
nest, and presently &lsquo;lost myself&rsquo; on the
common.&nbsp; It was nearly two o&rsquo;clock when I got to
Kildare from my last visit to that shameful
bush-village.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE
QUESTION.</span></h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Laws applying to
Street-walkers</i>&mdash;<i>The Keepers of the Haymarket
Night-houses</i>&mdash;<i>Present Position of the
Police-magistrates</i>.&mdash;<i>Music-hall
Frequenters</i>&mdash;<i>Refreshment-bars</i>&mdash;<i>Midnight
Profligacy</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Snuggeries</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Over-zealous
Blockheads</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> or seven years since, such
alterations were made in the laws applying to nocturnal
street-walkers and disorderly persons generally, as enabled the
London magistrates, with the assistance of the police, to reduce
the great Haymarket disgrace to manageable dimensions.&nbsp; To
completely abolish so renowned and prodigious a nuisance at a
blow was more than could be expected; but the public generally
were quite satisfied with the gradual and successful working of
the plans adopted for the final extinction of the infamous
&ldquo;oyster-shops,&rdquo; and caf&eacute;s, and wine-shops,
that in the olden time made night hideous from St.
James&rsquo;s-street to Piccadilly.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, the
good work has received a serious check.&nbsp; According to the
usual custom, the keeper of a refreshment-house, on being
summoned before the magistrate (Mr. Knox) for an infringement <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>of the Act,
was fined for the offence; and nothing else was expected but that
the fine would be paid, and, except for its salutary effect,
there an end of it.&nbsp; But it would seem that the fined
&ldquo;night-house&rdquo; keeper had cunning advisers, who
assured him that the conviction was bad, and that he had only to
appeal to a superior court to insure its being set aside.&nbsp;
The course suggested was adopted, and crowned with success.&nbsp;
Mr. Knox&rsquo;s decision was reversed, it not being clearly
shown that the loose women discovered on the premises were really
assembled for an immoral purpose.</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i>, commenting on this, says: &ldquo;It is
matter for general regret, since its probable result will be that
in future the keepers of the Haymarket &lsquo;night-houses&rsquo;
will do pretty much what they please, without let or
hindrance.&nbsp; It was decided by Sir William Bodkin and his
brother magistrates sitting at the Middlesex Sessions, on an
appeal brought from Marlborough-street, that no case is made out
against the keeper of a &lsquo;night-house,&rsquo; unless the
police can prove that the women found in the house were assembled
there for an immoral purpose; it was possible they might be there
merely for the legitimate purpose of refreshment, and not in
prosecution of their wretched trade.&nbsp; It is perfectly
obvious that this interpretation of the law, whether or not true
to the letter, utterly violates the spirit.&nbsp; The character
of the women who frequent these &lsquo;night-houses&rsquo; is
perfectly well known.&nbsp; They have, moreover, but one possible
object in frequenting them.&nbsp; It is clear, therefore, that
they come within the spirit of the law against harbouring <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>improper
characters quite as much as if they visited these houses actually
in company of men; and hence it follows that no new principle of
legislation, requiring long consideration and repeated
discussion, would be introduced if the law were made to reach
them.&nbsp; We should, in fact, be not making a new law, but
giving an old law its proper effect&mdash;an effect actually
given it, as Mr. Knox points out, for seven years, and latterly
with admirable results.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, we can
see no objection to replacing the law on its former satisfactory
footing by the simple expedient of a short clause in the Habitual
Criminals&rsquo; Bill.&nbsp; The Bill already deals with the low
beer-houses, which are the favourite resorts of certain dangerous
classes of the community; and the addition of a few words would
enable it to deal with such &lsquo;night-houses&rsquo; as those
we have been discussing.&nbsp; This would not interfere with
subsequent more mature and more comprehensive legislation on the
subject, while it would obviate the delay which has driven the
police authorities to desperation, and which threatens to give a
fresh lease to a grave national scandal, just as it was in the
way of being repressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old law alluded to by the <i>Times</i> is the Act of
Parliament of the 2d and 3d Vict. cap. 47, and is entitled
&ldquo;An Act for further empowering the Police in and near the
Metropolis;&rdquo; being an amendment of Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s
original statute, the 10th Geo. IV.&nbsp; Clauses 44, 52, 54, 58,
and 63, bear especially on the penalties incurred by disorderly
fallen women.</p>
<p><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>The
44th clause runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And whereas it is expedient that the
provisions made by law for preventing disorderly conduct in the
houses of licensed victuallers be extended to other houses of
public resort; be it enacted that every person who shall have or
keep any house, shop, room, or place of public resort within the
Metropolitan-Police district, wherein provisions, liquors, or
refreshments of any kind shall be sold or consumed (whether the
same shall be kept or retailed therein, or procured elsewhere),
and who shall wilfully or knowingly permit drunkenness or other
disorderly conduct in such house, shop, room, or place, or
knowingly suffer any unlawful games or any gaming whatsoever
therein, or knowingly suffer or permit <i>prostitutes</i>, or
persons of notoriously bad character, to meet together and remain
therein, shall for every such offence be liable to a penalty of
not more than five pounds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 52d clause of the same statute provides:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That it shall be lawful for the
Commissioners of Police from time to time, and as occasion may
require, to make regulation for the route to be observed by all
carts, carriages, horses, and persons, and for preventing
obstructions of the streets or thoroughfares within the
Metropolitan-Police district, in all times of public processions,
public rejoicings, or illuminations; and also to give directions
to the constables for keeping order and for preventing any
obstruction of the thoroughfares in the immediate neighbourhood
of her Majesty&rsquo;s palaces and public offices, the High Court
of Parliament, <a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>the courts of law and equity, the police-courts, the
theatres, and other places of public resort, and in any case when
the streets or thoroughfares may be thronged or may be liable to
be obstructed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 54th clause provides, in continuation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That every person who, after being made
acquainted with the regulations or directions which the
Commissioner of Police shall have made for regulating the route
of horses, carts, carriages, and persons during the time of
divine service, and for preventing obstructions during public
processions, and on other occasions hereinbefore specified, shall
wilfully disregard, or not conform himself thereto, shall be
liable to a penalty of not more than forty shillings.&nbsp; And
it shall be lawful for any constable belonging to the
Metropolitan-Police force to take into custody, <i>without
warrant</i>, any person who shall commit any such offence within
view of any such constable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same 54th clause also provides:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That every common prostitute or
night-walker, loitering, or being in any thoroughfare or public
place, for the purpose of prostitution or solicitation, to the
annoyance of the inhabitants or passengers, shall be liable to a
penalty of not more than forty shillings, and to be dealt with in
the same manner.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again, that &ldquo;every person who shall use any profane,
indecent, or obscene language to the annoyance of the inhabitants
or passengers;&rdquo; and also &ldquo;every person who shall use
any threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour with
intent to provoke <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>a breach of the peace, or whereby a breach of the peace
may be occasioned,&rdquo; may be also so dealt with.&nbsp; The
58th clause enacts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That every person who shall be found drunk
in any street or public thoroughfare within the said district,
and who while drunk shall be guilty of any riotous or indecent
behaviour, and also every person who shall be guilty of any
violent or indecent behaviour in any police station-house, shall
be liable to a penalty of not more than forty shillings for every
such offence or may be committed, if the magistrate by whom he is
convicted shall think fit, instead of inflicting upon him any
pecuniary fine, to the House of Correction for any time not more
than seven days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 63rd clause enacts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That it shall be lawful for any constable
belonging to the Metropolitan-Police district, and for all
persons whom he shall call to his assistance, to take into
custody, without a warrant, any person who within view of such
constable, shall offend in any manner against this Act, and whose
name and residence shall be unknown to such constable, and cannot
be ascertained by such constable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The police are, under the same Act, empowered to deal with
disorder, drunkenness, disorderly conduct brawling, loitering and
obstruction, whether coming by prostitutes or others.&nbsp;
Habitual loitering upon certain fixed spots they already keep in
check, generally speaking, without tyranny; and next comes to be
considered what can be done in case of what is called <a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>&ldquo;solicitation&rdquo; or importunity, a prominent
feature in the general hill of indictment against
prostitution.</p>
<p>To a person uninitiated in the law&rsquo;s subtleties, it
would seem that the clauses of the Act of Parliament above quoted
armed the police with all necessary authority, and that all that
was requisite was to compel the observance of the said clauses,
strictly and without favour, to insure a considerable mitigation
of the great evil.&nbsp; Indeed, as has been shown, believing
themselves justified in the course they have been for years
pursuing, the police have undoubtedly effected a vast and
important change in the aspect of the Haymarket and its
neighbourhood after midnight.&nbsp; The result, however, of the
Assistant-Judge&rsquo;s decision appears to have put the worthy
and indefatigable Mr. Knox quite out of heart, as may be gathered
from the subjoined newspaper account of the last case that was
brought before him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rose Burton, keeper of a refreshment-house
in Jermyn-street, lately known as Kate Franks, appeared to answer
two summonses for harbouring prostitutes.&nbsp; The police gave
the usual evidence.&nbsp; They visited the house at night.&nbsp;
They found men and women there; the women known prostitutes, some
taking refreshment.&nbsp; There was no disorder, and the usual
signal by ringing a bell had been given when the police presented
themselves at the house.&nbsp; For the defence it was urged, that
the evidence was similar to that given before the Middlesex
magistrates on appeal, after hearing which they quashed the
conviction, and that the magistrate should dismiss the
summonses.&nbsp; Mr. Knox <a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>said he must send the case to the
Sessions in order to get a clear declaration of what was
meant.&nbsp; If the judgment of the Court was against him, he
must wash his hands of the matter.&nbsp; He should inflict the
reduced fine of 10<i>s.</i> in order that the conviction should
be taken to the Sessions.&nbsp; Mr. Froggatt asked for a decision
in the second case.&nbsp; Mr. Knox would act in it the same as in
the last case.&nbsp; It was, so to say, a last desperate
effort.&nbsp; If he failed, his honest determination was to take
no further trouble in the matter; but to report to the Home
Office that the efforts to reform the condition of the Haymarket
had entirely broken down.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Lewis, after some
consultation with Mr. Allen jun. and Mr. Froggatt, said that,
owing to technical difficulties, it would be impossible to get an
appeal to Quarter Sessions before the 24th July.&nbsp; Mr. Knox
said that would be too late for Parliament to deal with the
matter, as the session would most probably close early in
August.&nbsp; There was no help for it; the nighthouse-keepers
must go on in their own way; the police might give up their
supervision and refrain from taking out summonses, as he
certainly should decline to convict.&nbsp; He should cancel the
three convictions that day, and dismiss the summonses; he was
powerless, and therefore disinclined to enforce what for seven
years had been considered as law, but what had been suddenly
upset at Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; Mr. Knox then requested Mr.
Superintendent Dunlop to communicate what had occurred to the
Commissioners of Police.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>At
the same time, it is no more than fair to lay before the reader
the explanation given by the Assistant-Judge on the last occasion
of the matter coming before him.&nbsp; It should be understood
that the case in question was not that of &ldquo;Rose
Burton,&rdquo; but of another of the fraternity who had been
fined by Mr. Knox.&nbsp; The party in question gave notice of
appeal, and the police authorities intimated their intention of
supporting the magistrate in his conviction.&nbsp; From some
unexplained cause, however, at the last moment the Commissioners
of Police withdrew altogether from the case, leaving it all
undefended to be dealt with by Mr. Bodkin.&nbsp; The judgment of
the learned Assistant-Judge was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are two cases in the paper of appeals
against convictions by Mr. Knox for causing or allowing
prostitutes to assemble; and upon these two cases being called,
counsel intimated that the solicitors of the Commissioners of
Police had written a letter to say that they should not support
these convictions.&nbsp; Under those circumstances no other
course was open to us but to quash them.&nbsp; But I mention the
fact now because these convictions have been the subject of
considerable comment and of interrogation in the House of
Commons.&nbsp; I can only say that there is no law in these cases
at all.&nbsp; It is entirely a question of fact, and each case
must stand upon its own merits.&nbsp; On one occasion we quashed
a conviction on the hearing, and upon that decision a great deal
has been said.&nbsp; The sole evidence there was, that a
policeman went into the <a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>house between twelve and one and
found men and women having refreshment, some of the women being
prostitutes.&nbsp; No question was asked; and there was nothing
to show that the person who kept the house knew they were
prostitutes.&nbsp; There was nothing to show that any warning had
been previously given against harbouring or encouraging them to
come.&nbsp; There was no ringing of any bell to give notice of
the approach of the police.&nbsp; In fact, there was nothing but
the mere incident that the police, before the hour of one, when
these houses should be closed, found persons in them taking
refreshments&mdash;some of those persons being prostitutes.&nbsp;
Although I do not shrink from taking on myself the chief
responsibility, there were many magistrates present who formed
their own opinion upon the question, which was a question of
fact; and it seemed so clearly not to be a case which satisfied
the requirements of the law, that we did not call upon the
counsel for the appellants, but at once quashed the
conviction.&nbsp; Indeed, after all that has been said, I have no
hesitation in stating that if another case came here, and was
presented to us in such a bald and unsatisfactory manner, we
should again quash the conviction.&nbsp; We are as desirous as
Mr. Knox to put an end to any nuisance, whether in the Haymarket
or elsewhere; but we cannot forget that we are in a court of law,
bound to act upon such testimony as is sworn before us, and not
to embark upon inquiries of another kind.&nbsp; There was not a
tittle of evidence as to ringing a bell, or of anything more than
persons taking refreshment within <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>the hours allowed by law, some of
those persons being &lsquo;unfortunates.&rsquo;&nbsp; I do not
think that any bench of magistrates in the kingdom could, under
the circumstances, have arrived at a different conclusion.&nbsp;
If other cases come before us, we shall treat them as we treated
the last, according to the effect of the sworn evidence in court,
and in no other way.&nbsp; I am very sorry if our decision should
have induced Mr. Knox, for whom I entertain a great respect, to
abstain from convicting in other cases, unless those were cases
of the same bald and unsatisfactory character as that which we
decided.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From one point of view maybe it is difficult to overrate the
importance of this judgment, especially if, as the <i>Times</i>
predicts, it will have the effect of giving the keepers of the
Haymarket haunts of infamy liberty to do pretty much as they
please.&nbsp; Laying too much stress on this Haymarket business,
however, may be harmful in another direction.&nbsp; It may lead
the public to the decidedly wrong conclusion that the well-known
thoroughfare indicated, and the taverns and refreshment-houses it
contains, are the head-quarters, the one main source, from which
flows the prodigious stream of immorality that floods the town
with contamination.</p>
<p>Now this is very far from being the fact.&nbsp; The extent to
which the Haymarket haunts are criminal is equalled, and in many
cases far excelled, in a dozen different parts of London every
night between the hours of ten and one&mdash;and that without
remonstrance or hindrance on the part of the police authorities
or anyone else.&nbsp; I allude to the London music-halls.&nbsp;
One <a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>of
the most disreputable was burnt down the other day; and it would
be a matter for rejoicing&mdash;for public thanksgiving
almost&mdash;if the score or so of similar places of popular
amusement, polluting every quarter of the metropolis, shared a
similar fate.&nbsp; To be sure, the music-halls keep within the
letter of the law in the matter of closing their doors before one
o&rsquo;clock; but in every other respect their operation is as
mischievous as any of the prosecuted dens at the West-end.&nbsp;
And I beg of the reader to distinctly understand that I am not
quoting from hearsay.&nbsp; There is not a single
music-hall&mdash;from the vast &ldquo;Alhambra&rdquo; in
Leicester-square, to the unaristocratic establishment in the
neighbourhood of Leather-lane, originally christened the
&ldquo;Raglan,&rdquo; but more popularly known as the
&ldquo;Rag&rdquo;&mdash;that I have not visited.&nbsp; And I am
bound to confess that the same damning elements are discoverable
in one and all.</p>
<p>At the same time it must be admitted&mdash;shameful and
disgraceful as the admission is&mdash;that it is not the
music-hall of the vulgar East-end or &ldquo;over the water&rdquo;
that presents in special prominence the peculiar features here
spoken of, and which, in plain language, are licentiousness and
prostitution.&nbsp; He who would witness the perfection to which
these twin curses may be wrought under the fostering influences
of &ldquo;music,&rdquo; &amp;c., must visit the west, and not the
east or south, of the metropolis.&nbsp; He must make a journey to
Leicester-square, and to the gorgeous and palatial Alhambra there
to be found.&nbsp; What he will there discover will open his <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>eyes to
what a farcical thing the law is, and how within the hour it will
strain at gnats, and bolt entire camels without so much as a wry
face or a wince, or a wink even.</p>
<p>I speak fearlessly, because all that I describe may be
witnessed to-night, to-morrow, any time, by the individual
adventurous and curious enough to go and see for himself.&nbsp;
There is no fear of his missing it; no chance of his fixing on a
wrong night.&nbsp; It is <i>always</i> the same at the
music-hall.&nbsp; Its meat is other men&rsquo;s poison; and it
can fatten and prosper while honesty starves.&nbsp; The bane and
curse of society is its main support; and to introduce the
purging besom would be to ruin the business.</p>
<p>At the same time, I would wish it to be distinctly understood,
that I do not desire to convey to the reader the impression that
the numerical majority of music-hall frequenters are persons of
immoral tendencies.&nbsp; On the contrary, I am well convinced
that such places are the resort of a vast number of the most
respectable portion of the working-class.&nbsp; This, I believe,
is a fact carefully treasured by music-hall proprietors, and
elaborately displayed by them whenever their morality is
attacked.&nbsp; They point to the well-filled body of the hall,
the sixpenny part, where artisans and working-men congregate, and
not unfrequently bring with them their wives and daughters; and
triumphantly inquire, &ldquo;Is it likely that the music-hall can
be what slanderers represent, when it is so
patronised?&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is quite true that a very large
number of honest and intelligent <a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>folk are attracted thither in search
of harmless amusement.&nbsp; Let them bless God for their
ignorance of the world&rsquo;s wicked ways if they succeed in
finding it.&nbsp; It is not impossible.&nbsp; Provided they look
neither to the right nor left of them, but pay their sixpence at
the door, and march to the seats apportioned them; and, still at
eyes right, direct their gaze and their organs of hearing towards
the stage, from which the modern &ldquo;comic vocalist&rdquo;
doles out to a stolen tune feeble jingling idiotcies of
&ldquo;his own composing,&rdquo;&mdash;if they are steadfast to
this, they may come away not much the worse for the
evening&rsquo;s entertainment.&nbsp; But let him not look about
him, especially if he have his wife or daughters with him, or he
may find himself tingling with a feeling it was never his
misfortune to experience before.</p>
<p>The honest believer in the harmlessness of music-halls would,
if he looked about him as he sat in the sixpenny
&ldquo;pit,&rdquo; discover in more quarters than one that which
would open his innocent eyes.&nbsp; If his vision were directed
upwards towards the boxes and balconies, there he would discover
it.&nbsp; Brazen-faced women blazoned in tawdry finely, and
curled and painted, openly and without disguise bestowing their
blandishments on &ldquo;spoony&rdquo; young swells of the
&ldquo;commercial&rdquo; and shopman type, for the sake of the
shilling&rsquo;s-worth of brandy-and-water that steams before
them, and in prospect of future advantages.&nbsp; There is no
mistaking these women.&nbsp; They do not go there to be
mistaken.&nbsp; They make no more disguise of their profession
than <a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>do
cattle-drovers in the public markets.&nbsp; They are there in
pursuit of their ordinary calling, and, splendid creatures though
they appear, it is curious to witness the supreme indifference to
them of the door-keepers as they flaunt past them.&nbsp; It makes
good the old proverb about the familiarity that breeds contempt;
besides, as a customer in simple, the painted free-drinking lady
is not desirable.&nbsp; I should not for a moment wish to impute
without substantial proof so dastardly a feature of
&ldquo;business&rdquo; to any spirited music-hall proprietor in
particular; but I am positively assured by those who should know,
that on certain recognised nights loose women are admitted to
these places <i>without payment</i>.&nbsp; I know as a fact, too,
that it is no uncommon thing for these female music-hall
frequenters to enlist the services of cabmen on
&ldquo;spec,&rdquo; the latter conveying their &ldquo;fare&rdquo;
to the Alhambra or the Philharmonic without present payment, on
the chance that she will in the course of the evening &ldquo;pick
up a flat,&rdquo; who will with the lady require his services to
drive them to the Haymarket or elsewhere.&nbsp; How much of
extortion and robbery may be committed under such a convenient
cloak it is not difficult to guess.&nbsp; The evidence not being
quite so unobjectionable as it might be, I will not mention
names; but I was recently informed with apparent sincerity by one
of those poor bedizened unfortunates&mdash;a &ldquo;dress
lodger&rdquo; possibly&mdash;that a certain music-hall proprietor
issued to women of her class &ldquo;weekly tickets&rdquo; at
half-price, the main condition attaching to the advantage being
that the holder did not &ldquo;ply&rdquo; in the low-priced <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>parts of
the hall; that is to say, amongst those who could afford to pay
for nothing more expensive than pints of beer.</p>
<p>But it is at the refreshment-bars of these palatial shams and
impostures, as midnight and closing time approaches, that
profligacy may be seen reigning rampant.&nbsp; Generally at one
end of the hall is a long strip of metal counter, behind which
superbly-attired barmaids vend strong liquors.&nbsp; Besides
these there are &ldquo;snuggeries,&rdquo; or small private
apartments, to which bashful gentlemen desirous of sharing a
bottle of wine with a recent acquaintance may retire.&nbsp; But
the unblushing immodesty of the place concentrates at this long
bar.&nbsp; Any night may here be found <i>dozens</i> of
prostitutes enticing simpletons to drink, while the men who are
<i>not</i> simpletons hang about, smoking pipes and cigars, and
merely sipping, not drinking deeply, and with watchful wary eyes
on the pretty game of fox-and-goose that is being played all
round about them.&nbsp; No one molests them, or hints that their
behaviour is at variance with &ldquo;the second and third of
Victoria, cap. 47.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here they are in dozens, in
scores, prostitutes every one, doing exactly as they do at the
infamous and prosecuted Haymarket dens, and no one
interferes.&nbsp; I say, doing all that the Haymarket woman does;
and it must be so, since the gay patroness of the music-halls
does simply all she can to lure the dupe she may at the moment
have in tow.&nbsp; She entices him to drink; she drinks with him:
she ogles, and winks, and whispers, and encourages like behaviour
on his part, her main undisguised <a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>object being to induce him to
prolong the companionship after the glaring gaslight of the
liquor-bar is lowered, and its customers are shown to the outer
door.&nbsp; If that is not &ldquo;knowingly suffering prostitutes
to meet together&rdquo; for the more convenient prosecution of
their horrible trade, what else is it?&nbsp; And yet the cunning
schemes and contrivances for misleading and throwing dust in the
eyes of the police are not practised here.&nbsp; There are no
scouts and &ldquo;bells,&rdquo; the former causing the latter to
chime a warning on the approach of the enemy.&nbsp; The enemy,
the police, that is to say, are on the spot.&nbsp; In almost
every case there will be found in the music-hall lobby an
intelligent liveried guardian of the public peace, here stationed
that he may take cognisance of suspicious-looking persons, and
eject improper characters.&nbsp; Should he happen, as is most
likely, to be a policeman whose &ldquo;beat&rdquo; is in the
neighbourhood, he will by sight be quite familiar with every
loose woman who for a mile round in the streets plies her lawless
trade.&nbsp; He recognises them, as with a nod of old
acquaintance they pass the money-taker; he saunters to the bar,
where the women gather to prime their prey, and he witnesses
their doings, but he takes no notice, and never complains.</p>
<p>To be sure, the man is not to blame; were he ordered to
disperse congregations of prostitutes wherever he found them, and
to warn the persons who dispense liquors to them&mdash;just as is
expected of him in the case of the ordinary
public-house&mdash;that they are harbouring bad characters, and
must cease to do so, undoubtedly the <a name="page321"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 321</span>policeman would perform his
duty.&nbsp; Until he receives express orders on the subject,
however, he is helpless, and very properly so.&nbsp; Although one
would desire to see ample powers for the suppression of
prostitution placed in the hands of the police, it is highly
necessary that the said power, in the hands of ordinary constable
X, should be scrupulously watched by those who are set in
authority over him.&nbsp; Policemen make sad mistakes at times,
as witness the following monstrous instance, furnished by the
police-reports not more than a month since:</p>
<p>At Southwark, Mrs. Catherine C&mdash;, aged twenty-eight, the
wife of a respectable man in the employ of the South-Eastern
Railway Company, but who was described on the charge-sheet as a
prostitute, was charged by Jas. Benstead, police-constable 17 M
Reserve, with soliciting prostitution near the London-bridge
railway terminus.&nbsp; The constable said that about ten
o&rsquo;clock on the previous night he was on duty near the
railway terminus, when he saw the prisoner accost a
gentleman.&nbsp; Believing her to be a prostitute, he went up to
the gentleman, and from what he said he took her into custody for
soliciting him.&nbsp; The prisoner here said she had been most
cruelly used.&nbsp; She was a respectable married woman, and
lived with her husband in the Drummond-road, Bermondsey.&nbsp;
She had been to see her sister at Peckham, and had a
return-ticket for the Spa-road; but when she arrived at the
London-bridge terminus, she was too late for the train;
consequently she determined to walk home, and as soon as she
turned <a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>into Duke-street, a gentleman stopped her and asked her
whether there was an omnibus left there for Whitechapel.&nbsp;
She told him she did not know, and as soon as he left, the
constable came up and took her into custody.&nbsp; She had been
locked up all night.&nbsp; The prisoner here produced the half of
a return-ticket for the magistrate&rsquo;s inspection.&nbsp; The
husband of the prisoner said he was in the employ of the
South-Eastern Railway Company, and resided at No. 190
Drummond-road, Bermondsey.&nbsp; His wife left home on the
previous afternoon to visit her sister at Peckham, and he
expected her home at ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; He was surprised at
her absence, and as soon as he ascertained she was locked up, he
went to the police-station, but was not permitted to see
her.&nbsp; He could produce several witnesses to prove the
respectability of his wife.&nbsp; Mr. Burcham ordered the
prisoner to be discharged immediately.</p>
<p>And so terminated the case as far as the magistrate was
concerned; but one cannot help feeling curious to know whether no
more was done in the matter.&nbsp; The outraged and cruelly-used
woman was discharged, but was Reserve-constable James Benstead
permitted to retain his situation in the police-force?&nbsp; How
did the monstrous &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; arise?&nbsp; It is
evident that the poor young woman spoke the truth; Mr. Burcham
settled that point by ordering her immediate discharge.&nbsp;
From any point of view, James Benstead showed himself utterly
unworthy to remain a constable.&nbsp; In interfering with a
decently-dressed woman, who must have been a stranger to him,
simply because he saw her &ldquo;accost <a
name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>a
gentleman,&rdquo; he exhibited himself in the light of an
over-zealous blockhead.&nbsp; If the woman&rsquo;s statement is
to be believed, he told a wicked and malicious lie when he said
that he took her into custody &ldquo;on account of what the
gentleman told him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where one is left in the dark,
to solve a mystery as one best may, it is not impossible that one
may guess wide of the mark; but it will under such conditions
occur to the recollection that before now
&ldquo;unfortunates,&rdquo; new to the life, have given deadly
offence to policemen by not &ldquo;paying their footing,&rdquo;
as black-mail of a certain abominable kind is called; and
blundering James Benstead may have sustained a pecuniary
disappointment.&nbsp; It is to be sincerely hoped that that
secret tribunal before which erring policemen are arraigned
(where is it?) will not let so flagrant a case pass without
notice; and if, after close investigation, policeman James
Benstead is proved to be the dangerous person he appears, that he
may be promptly stripped of his official uniform.&nbsp; Even
supposing that James Benstead is nothing worse than a blundering
Jack-in-office, he is just of the sort to bring the law into
contempt and ridicule, and the sooner he is cashiered the
better.</p>

<i>and</i> &ldquo;<i>Do-nothing</i>&rdquo;
<i>Principle</i>&mdash;<i>The Emigration of Women of Bad
Character</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is easy enough to understand, if
one finds the courage to face this worst of all social evils, and
inquire calmly into the many shapes its origin takes, how very
possible it is that there may be living in a state of depravity
scores and hundreds of women who are what they are out of no real
<i>fault</i> of their own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why do they not
turn, and reform their infamous lives?&rdquo; the indignant
reader may ask.&nbsp; &ldquo;They may if they will.&nbsp; Is
there not this, that, and the other asylum open to
them?&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps so.&nbsp; Only perhaps.&nbsp; But for
reasons hinted at in the commencement of this chapter, it might
be clearly enough shown that, &ldquo;this, that, and
t&rsquo;other,&rdquo; to a very large extent, really and truly
represent the substantiality of the asylums to which the curse is
admitted for purgation.&nbsp; We have foolishly and blindly
ignored the evil, and consequently we have not been free to
provide adequately for the reception of those who have lived in
it, and are now desirous of returning, <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>if they
may, to decent life.&nbsp; We have some asylums of the kind; but
in capacity they are about as well adapted to perform the
prodigious amount of work ready for them as a ten-gallon filter
would be to purify the muddy waters of the Thames.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there are thousands of debased and wanton wretches
for whom the doors of such houses of reform and refuge, did they
exist in plenty, might in vain stand open.&nbsp; But let the
reader for a moment consider how many there are at this moment
whose fall was mainly due to misplaced trust and foolish
confidence, and who are kept in their degradation out of a sort
of mad and bitter spite against themselves.&nbsp; As everyone can
vouch who has taken an interest in these fallen ones, and kindly
questioned them on their condition and their willingness to turn
from it, nothing is more common in their mouths than the answer,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a life good enough
for me.&nbsp; A pretty image I should appear in well-bred
company, shouldn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use your
preaching to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made my bed, and I must lie on
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it would be found in countless cases that
these poor wretches did not in the original &ldquo;make their
bed,&rdquo; as they call it, and that it reveals a wonderful
amount of forgiving and generosity in them to profess that they
did.&nbsp; If we could discover the truth, we might get at the
real bed-makers&mdash;the villanous conjurers of couches of roses
that were so speedily to turn to thorns and briars&mdash;in the
seducer and the base deserter.&nbsp; If ever the Legislature
finds courage enough to take up this great question in earnest,
<a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>it is to
be hoped that ample provision will be made for the proper
treatment of the heartless scoundrel.&nbsp; As says a writer in
an old number of the <i>Westminster Review</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The <i>deserter</i>, not the seducer,
should be branded with the same kind and degree of reprobation
with which society now visits the coward and the cheat.&nbsp; The
man who submits to insult rather than fight; the gambler who
packs the cards, or loads the dice, or refuses to pay his debts
of honour, is hunted from among even his unscrupulous associates
as a stained and tarnished character.&nbsp; <i>Let the same
measure of retributive justice be dealt to the seducer who
deserts the woman who has trusted him</i>, <i>and allows her to
come upon the town</i>.&nbsp; We say the deserter&mdash;not the
seducer; for there is as wide a distinction between them as there
is between the gamester and the sharper.&nbsp; Mere seduction
will never be visited with extreme severity among men of the
world, however correct and refined may be their general tone of
morals; for they will always make large allowances on the score
of youthful passions, favouring circumstances, and excited
feeling.&nbsp; Moreover, they well know that there is a wide
distinction&mdash;that there are all degrees of
distinction&mdash;between a man who commits a fault of this kind,
under the influence of warm affections and a fiery temperament,
and the cold-hearted, systematic assailer of female virtue, whom
all reprobate and shun.&nbsp; It is universally felt that you
cannot, with any justice, class these men in the same category,
nor mete out to them the same measure of <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>condemnation.&nbsp; But the man who, when his caprice
is satisfied, casts off his victim as a worn-out garment or a
damaged toy; who allows the woman who trusted his protestations
to sink from the position of his companion to the loathsome life
of prostitution, because his seduction and desertion has left no
other course open to her; who is not ready to make any sacrifice
of place, of fortune, of reputation even, in order to save one
whom he has once loved from such an abyss of wretched
infamy&mdash;must surely be more stained, soiled, and hardened in
soul, more utterly unfitted for the company or sympathy of
gentlemen or men of honour, than any coward, any gambler, any
cheat!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may not lay claim to being the discoverer of this
well-written outburst of manly indignation.&nbsp; It is quoted by
a gentleman&mdash;a medical gentleman&mdash;who has inquired
deeper and written more to the real purpose on this painful
subject than any other writer with whom I am acquainted.&nbsp; I
allude to Dr. Acton.&nbsp; The volume that contains it is of
necessity not one that might be introduced to the drawing-room,
but it is one that all thinking men would do well to procure and
peruse.&nbsp; Dr. Acton handles a tremendously difficult matter
masterly and courageously; and while really he is of as delicate
a mind as a lady, he does not scruple to enunciate his honest
convictions respecting the prevalent evil of prostitution, as
though it were an evil as commonly recognised and as freely
discussed as begging or thieving.&nbsp; In his introductory pages
he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To those who profess a real or fictitious
ignorance <a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>of prostitution, its miseries and its ill-effects, and
those again who plead conscience for inaction, I have this one
reply.&nbsp; Pointing to the outward signs of prostitution in our
streets and hospitals, I inquire whether we can flatter ourselves
that the subject has drifted into a satisfactory state on the
&lsquo;know-nothing&rsquo; and &lsquo;do-nothing&rsquo;
principle.&nbsp; I hint at the perilous self-sufficiency of the
Pharisee, and the wilful blindness of the Levite who
&lsquo;passed by on the other side,&rsquo; and I press upon them
that, after reading this work and testing its author&rsquo;s
veracity, they should either refute its arguments or be
themselves converted. . . .&nbsp; I have little to say in the way
of apology for my plain-speaking.&nbsp; The nature of the subject
has forced this upon me.&nbsp; To have called things here treated
of by another than their right name would have been in any writer
an absurdity, in me a gross one.&nbsp; The experiences I have
collected may to optimists and recluses appear exaggerated.&nbsp;
The visions I have indulged in may be hard to grasp.&nbsp; But
this more complicated knot demands a swordsman, not an
infant.&nbsp; The inhabitants of a provincial city demanded of
Lord Palmerston that the angel of pestilence should be stayed by
a day of national prayer and fasting.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will fast
with you and pray with you,&rsquo; was the statesman&rsquo;s
answer; &lsquo;but let us also drain, scrub, wash, and be
clean.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If by this taste of the preface to Dr. Acton&rsquo;s book I
induce my male readers to dip into it for themselves, I shall
feel that I have done the cause the worthy writer has at heart
good service.&nbsp; It will be something if <a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>the brief
quotation bespeaks attention to the other extracts from the same
genuine source that herein appear.&nbsp; On the subject of
seduction and desertion, Mr. Acton writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I could not get imprisonment of the male
party to a seduction substituted for the paltry fine of
half-a-crown a-week, I would at least give to the commonwealth,
now liable to a pecuniary damage by bastardy, some interest in
its detection and punishment.&nbsp; The union-house is now often
enough the home of the deserted mother and the infant bastard;
and the guardians of the poor ought, I think, to have the right,
in the interest of the commune, to act as bastardy police, and to
be recouped their charges.&nbsp; I would not allow the
maintenance of an illegitimate child to be at the expense of any
but the father.&nbsp; I would make it the incubus on him, not on
its mother; and I would not leave his detection, exposure, and
money loss at the option of the latter.&nbsp; A young man who has
a second and third illegitimate child, by different women, has
not lived without adding some low cunning to his nature.&nbsp; It
often happens that a fellow of this sort will, for a time, by
specious promises and presents to a girl he fully intends
ultimately to desert, defer making any payments for or on account
of her child.&nbsp; If he can for twelve months, and without
entering into any shadow of an agreement (and we may all guess
how far the craft of an injured woman will help her to one that
would hold water), stave-off any application on her part to the
authorities, her claim at law is barred; and she herself, <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>defied at
leisure, becomes in due course chargeable to her parish or
union.&nbsp; But not thus should a virtuous state connive at the
obligations of paternity being shuffled on to its public
shoulders, when, by a very trifling modification of the existing
machinery, they might be adjusted on the proper back, permanently
or temporarily, as might be considered publicly expedient.&nbsp;
I would enact, I say, by the help of society, that, in the first
place, the seduction of a female, properly proved, should involve
the male in a heavy pecuniary fine, according to his
position&mdash;not at all by way of punishment, but to
strengthen, by the very firm abutment of the breeches-pocket,
both him and his good resolutions against the temptations and
force of designing woman.&nbsp; I would not offer the latter, as
I foresee will be instantaneously objected, this bounty upon
sinfulness&mdash;this incentive to be a seducer; but, on the
contrary, the money should be due to the community, and
recoverable in the county-court or superior court at the suit of
its engine, the union; and should be invested by the treasurer of
such court, or by the county, or by some public trustee in
bastardy, for the benefit of the mother and child.&nbsp; The
child&rsquo;s portion of this deodand should be retained by such
public officer until the risk of its becoming chargeable to the
community quasi-bastard should be removed by the mother&rsquo;s
marriage or otherwise; and the mother&rsquo;s share should be for
her benefit as an emigration-fund or marriage-portion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot imagine,&rdquo; says another authority, <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>&ldquo;that
anyone can seriously suppose that prostitution would be made
either more generally attractive or respectable by the greater
decency and decorum which administrative supervision would compel
it to throw over its exterior.&nbsp; We know that the absence of
these does not deter one of irregular passions from the low
pursuit; and we know, moreover, wherever these are needed for the
behoof of a more scrupulous and refined class of fornicators,
they are to be found.&nbsp; We are convinced also that much of
the permanent ruin to the feelings and character which results
from the habit of visiting the haunts of prostitution is to be
attributed to the coarse language and the brutal manners which
prevail there; and that this vice, like many others, would lose
much of its evil by losing all of grossness that is separable
from it.&nbsp; Nor do we fear that the improvement in the
<i>tone</i> of prostitution which would thus result would render
its unhappy victims less anxious to escape from it.&nbsp; Soften
its horrors and gild its loathsomeness as you may, there will
always remain enough to revolt all who are not wholly lost.&nbsp;
Much too&mdash;everything almost&mdash;is gained, if you can
retain <i>any</i> degree of self-respect among the fallen.&nbsp;
The more of this that remains, the greater chance is there of
ultimate redemption; it is always a mistaken and a cruel policy
to allow vice to grow desperate and reckless.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
for the interest of society at large, as well as for that of the
guilty individual, that we should never break down the bridge
behind such a sinner as the miserable &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo;
even.</p>

332</span>V.&mdash;The Curse of Drunkenness.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ITS POWER.</span></h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The crowning Curse</i>&mdash;<i>No form of
sin or sorrow in which it does not play a
part</i>&mdash;<i>The</i> &ldquo;<i>Slippery Stone</i>&rdquo;
<i>of Life</i>&mdash;<i>Statistics</i>&mdash;<i>Matters not
growing worse</i>&mdash;<i>The Army Returns</i>&mdash;<i>The
System of Adulteration</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> differences of opinion may
arise as to the extent and evil operation of the other curses
that, in common with all other cities, afflict the city of
London, no sane man will contest the fact that drunkenness has
wrought more mischief than all other social evils put
together.&nbsp; There is not a form of human sin and sorrow in
which it does not constantly play a part.&nbsp; It is the
&ldquo;slippery stone&rdquo; that in countless instances has
betrayed the foot careless or over-confident, and the
downhill-path is trod never to be retraced.&nbsp; As Dr. Guthrie
writes: &ldquo;Believe me, it is impossible to exaggerate,
impossible even truthfully to paint, the effect of this evil,
either on those who are addicted to it or on those who suffer
from it; crushed husbands, broken-hearted <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>wives, and,
most of all, those poor innocent children that are dying under
cruelty and starvation, that shiver in their rags upon our
streets, that walk unshod the winter snows, and, with their
matted hair and hollow cheeks, and sunken eyes, glare out on us
wild and savage-like from patched and filthy windows.&nbsp; Nor
is the curse confined to the lowest stratum of society.&nbsp;
Much improved as are the habits of the upper and middle classes,
the vice may still be met in all classes of society.&nbsp; It has
cost many a servant her place, and yet greater loss&mdash;ruined
her virtue; it has broken the bread of many a tradesman; it has
spoiled the coronet of its lustre, and sunk the highest rank into
contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is satisfactory, however, to discover that matters are not
growing worse.</p>
<p>In the number of persons &ldquo;summarily proceeded
against&rdquo; for divers offences, we find a steady decrease
during the last three years in the numbers charged with
&ldquo;drunkenness&rdquo; and being &ldquo;drunk and
disorderly,&rdquo; the respective figures being 105,310, 104,368,
and 100,357, showing a diminution in the three years of nearly
5,000 cases per annum.&nbsp; In the total number of inquests for
1867, viz. 24,648, there is a decrease of 278, as compared with
the number in the preceding year.&nbsp; In the verdicts of murder
there is a decrease of 17, and of manslaughter 44, or 19.7 per
cent, following a decrease of 59, or 20.9 per cent, as compared
with the number in 1865.&nbsp; Under &ldquo;natural death,&rdquo;
as compared with the numbers for 1866, there is a decrease of 51,
or 13.6 per cent, in the verdicts <a name="page334"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>&ldquo;from excessive
drinking,&rdquo; following a decrease of 12 in 1866, as compared
with the number in 1865.&nbsp; The number of persons committed or
bailed for trial for indictable offences during the year, as
shown in the police-returns, was 19,416, and of these it may be
calculated that about 14,562 (75 per cent being about the usual
proportion) would be convicted.&nbsp; To this number is to be
added (in order to show the total number of convictions during
the year) 335,359 summary convictions before the magistrates
(280,196 males and 55,163 females).&nbsp; A large proportion of
these cases were, it is true, for offences of a trifling
character.&nbsp; They include, however, 74,288 cases of
&ldquo;drunkenness&rdquo; and being &ldquo;drunk and
disorderly&rdquo; (59,071 males and 15,217 females), and 10,085
offences against the Licensed Victuallers&rsquo; and Beer Acts,
viz. 6,506 by beershop-keepers (5,792 males and 714 females);
3,258 by licensed victuallers (2,944 males and 314 females); the
remaining 321 (293 males and 28 females) consisting of other
offences under the above Acts.&nbsp; The total number of
convictions for offences against the Refreshment Houses&rsquo;
Act was 3,032, viz. 2,871 males and 161 females.</p>
<p>This as regards civilians and those over whom the police have
control.&nbsp; The army-returns, however, are not so
favourable.</p>
<p>The last annual report of Lieutenant-Colonel Henderson, R.E.,
the Inspector-General of Military Prisons, reveals the startling
fact that, &ldquo;during four years the committals for
drunkenness have steadily increased as <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>follows:
1863, 882; 1864, 1,132; 1865, 1,801; 1866, 1,926.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector-General observes that the explanation of this
increase &ldquo;is to be found in the fact that soldiers who
formerly were summarily convicted and sentenced to short periods
of imprisonment in regimental cells by their commanding officers
for drunkenness are now tried by court-martial and sentenced to
imprisonment in a military prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; But precisely the
same explanation was given, in the report for the preceding year,
of the increase of the committals in 1865 over those in
1864.&nbsp; Therefore, however applicable this consideration
might have been to a comparison with former periods when
drunkenness was not dealt with by court-martial, it totally fails
to account for the further increase which has occurred since the
change was made.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that the 1,926 cases in the year 1866
were cases of simple drunkenness, such as we see disposed of in
the police-courts by a fine of five shillings.&nbsp; The offence
was &ldquo;habitual drunkenness,&rdquo; of which there are
several definitions in the military code; but much the largest
portion of the committals are for having been drunk &ldquo;for
the fourth time within 365 days.&rdquo;&nbsp; In order,
therefore, to form a just idea of the prevalence of this vice in
the army, we must add to the cases brought before a court-martial
the far more numerous instances in which the offenders are
discovered less than four times a year, and are punished by their
commanding officers, or in which <a name="page336"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 336</span>they are not discovered at
all.&nbsp; Drunkenness is <i>the</i> vice of the army.&nbsp; The
state of feeling which pervaded society two generations ago still
survives in the army.&nbsp; That species of &ldquo;good
fellowship,&rdquo; which is only another name for mutual
indulgence in intoxicating drink, is still in the ascendant in
the most popular of English professions, and from this
vantage-ground it exercises an injurious influence over the moral
condition of the entire community.</p>
<p>The following order, relative to the punishment of drunkenness
in the army, as directed by the Horse Guards, has just been
published:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;First and second acts, admonition or
confinement to barracks at the discretion of the commanding
officer.&nbsp; For every subsequent act of drunkenness within
three months of former act, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; if over three
and within six months, 5<i>s.</i>; if over six and within nine
months, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; if over nine and within twelve
months, company entry; if over twelve months, to be treated as
the first act.&nbsp; When the four preceding acts have been
committed in twelve months, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to be added to
the foregoing amounts, and the <i>maximum</i> daily stoppage is
to be 2<i>d.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drink, strong drink, is responsible for very much of the
misery that afflicts our social state; but it is scarcely fair to
much-abused Alcohol&mdash;a harmless spirit enough except when
abused&mdash;to attribute to it all the ruin that flows from the
bottle and the public-house gin-tap.&nbsp; Alcohol has enough to
answer for; but there can be no doubt that for one victim to its
intoxicating qualities, <a name="page337"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 337</span>two might be reckoned who have
&ldquo;come to their deathbed&rdquo; through the various deadly
poisons it is the publican&rsquo;s custom to mix with his diluted
liquors to give them a fictitious strength and fire.&nbsp; Let us
here enumerate a few of the ingredients with which the
beer-shop-keeper re-brews his beer, and the publican
&ldquo;doctors&rdquo; his gin and rum and whisky.</p>
<p>As is well known, the most common way of adulterating beer is
by means of <i>cocculus indicus</i>.&nbsp; This is known
&ldquo;in the trade&rdquo; as &ldquo;Indian berry,&rdquo; and is
the fruit of a plant that grows on the coast of Malabar.&nbsp; It
is a small kidney-shaped, rough, and black-looking berry, of a
bitter taste, and of an intoxicating or poisonous quality.&nbsp;
It is extensively used to increase the intoxicating properties of
the liquor.</p>
<p>Fox-glove is a plant with large purple flowers, possessing an
intensely bitter nauseous taste.&nbsp; It is a violent purgative
and vomit; produces languor, giddiness, and even death.&nbsp; It
is a poison, and is used on account of the bitter and
intoxicating qualities it imparts to the liquor among which it is
mixed.</p>
<p>Green copperas, a mineral substance obtained from iron, is
much used to give the porter a frothy top.&nbsp; The green
copperas is supposed to give to porter in the pewter-pot that
peculiar flavour which drinkers say is not to be tasted when the
liquor is served in glass.</p>
<p>Hartshorn shavings are the horns of the common male deer
rasped or scraped down.&nbsp; They are then boiled in the worts
of ale, and give out a substance <a name="page338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>of a thickisk nature like jelly,
which is said to prevent intoxicating liquor from becoming
sour.</p>
<p>Henbane, a plant of a poisonous nature, bearing a close
resemblance to the narcotic poison, opium.&nbsp; It produces
intoxication, delirium, nausea, vomiting, feverishness, and
death, and appears chiefly to be used to increase the
intoxicating properties of intoxicating liquors; or, in other
words, to render them more likely to produce these effects in
those who use these liquors.</p>
<p>Jalap, the root of a sort of convolvulus, brought from the
neighbourhood of Xalapa, in Mexico, and so called Jalap.&nbsp; It
is used as a powerful purgative in medicine.&nbsp; Its taste is
exceedingly nauseous; and is of a sweetish bitterness.&nbsp; It
is used to prevent the intoxicating liquor from turning sour; and
probably to counteract the binding tendency of some of the other
ingredients.</p>
<p>Multum is a mixture of opium and other ingredients, used to
increase the intoxicating qualities of the liquor.</p>
<p>Nut-galls are excrescences produced by the attacks of a small
insect on the tender shoots of a tree which grows in Asia, Syria,
and Persia.&nbsp; They are of a bitter taste, and are much used
in dyeing.&nbsp; They are also used to colour or fine the
liquor.</p>
<p>Nux vomica is the seed of a plant all parts of which are of a
bitter and poisonous nature.&nbsp; The seeds of this plant are
found in the fruit, which is about the size of an orange.&nbsp;
The seeds are about an inch <a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>round and about a quarter of an inch
thick.&nbsp; They have no smell.&nbsp; It is a violent narcotic
acrid poison, and has been used very extensively in the
manufacture of intoxicating ale, beer, and porter.</p>
<p>Opium is the thickened juice of the white poppy, which grows
most abundantly in India, though it also grows in Britain.&nbsp;
It is the most destructive of narcotic poisons, and it is the
most intoxicating.&nbsp; It has been most freely used in the
manufacture of intoxicating liquors, because its very nature is
to yield a larger quantity of intoxicating matter than any other
vegetable.</p>
<p>Oil of vitriol, or sulphuric acid, is a mineral poison of a
burning nature.&nbsp; In appearance it is oily and colourless,
and has no smell.&nbsp; It is used to increase the heating
qualities of liquor.</p>
<p>Potash is made from vegetables mixed with quicklime, boiled
down in pots and burnt&mdash;the ashes remaining after the
burning being the potash.&nbsp; It is used to prevent the beer
souring, or to change it, if it has become sour.</p>
<p>Quassia is the name of a tree which grows in America and the
West Indies.&nbsp; Both the wood and the fruit are of an
intensely bitter taste.&nbsp; It is used instead of hops to
increase the bitter in the liquor.</p>
<p>Wormwood is a plant or flower with downy leaves, and small
round-headed flowers.&nbsp; The seed of this plant has bitter and
stimulating qualities, and is used to increase the exciting and
intoxicating qualities of liquors.</p>
<p><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>Yew
tops, the produce of the yew-tree.&nbsp; The leaves are of an
extremely poisonous nature, and so are the tops, or berries and
seeds.&nbsp; It is used to increase the intoxicating properties
of the liquors.</p>
<p>The quantities of cocculus-indicus berries, as well as of
black extract, brought into this country for adulterating malt
liquors, are enormous.&nbsp; The berries in question are
ostensibly destined for the use of tanners and dyers.&nbsp; Most
of the articles are transmitted to the consumer in their
disguised state, or in such a form that their real nature cannot
possibly be detected by the unwary.&nbsp; An extract, said to be
innocent, sold in casks containing from half a cwt. to five cwt.
by the brewers&rsquo; druggists, under the name of
&ldquo;bittern,&rdquo; is composed of calcined sulphate of iron
(copperas), extract of cocculus-indicus berries, extract of
quassia and Spanish liquorice.&nbsp; This fraud constitutes by
far the most censurable offence committed by unprincipled
brewers.</p>
<p>To both ale and porter an infusion of hops is added, and in
general porter is more highly hopped than ale.&nbsp; New ale and
porter, which are free from acid, are named mild; those which
have been kept for some time, and in which acid is developed, are
called hard.&nbsp; Some prefer hard beer; and to suit this taste,
the publicans are accustomed, when necessary, to convert mild
beer into hard by a summary and simple process, to wit, the
addition of sulphuric acid.&nbsp; Again, others prefer mild beer;
and the publicans, when their supply of this is low, and they
have an abundance of old or hard beer, <a
name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>convert the
latter into mild, by adding to it soda, potash, carbonate of
lime, &amp;c.&nbsp; Various other adulterations are
practised.&nbsp; The narcotic quality of hop is replaced by
cocculus indicus; sweetness and colour by liquorice (an innocent
fraud); thickness by lint-seed; a biting pungency by caraway-seed
and cayenne-pepper.&nbsp; Quassia is also said to be used, with
the latter view.&nbsp; Treacle is likewise employed to give
sweetness and consistency; while to give beer a frothy surface,
sulphate of iron and alum are had recourse to.&nbsp; Such is the
wholesome beverage of which nine-tenths of the English people
daily partake!</p>
<p>Nor is the more aristocratic and expensive liquid that assumes
the name of wine exempt from the &ldquo;doctor&rsquo;s&rdquo;
manipulations.&nbsp; Mr. Cyrus Redding, in his evidence before a
select committee, describes the mode by which wines are made by
manufacturers in London.&nbsp; He stated that brandy
cowl&mdash;that is, washings of brandy-casks&mdash;colouring,
probably made of elder-berries, logwood, salt-of-tartar,
gum-dragon, tincture of red sanders or cudbear, were extensively
used in preparing an article which sells as port.&nbsp; The
entire export of port-wine is 20,000 pipes, and yet 60,000, as
given in evidence, are annually consumed in this country.&nbsp;
As regards champagne, the same authority says, &ldquo;In England,
champagne has been made from white and raw sugar, crystallised
lemon or tartaric acid, water, homemade grape-wine, or perry, and
French brandy.&nbsp; Cochineal or strawberries have been added to
imitate the pinks.&nbsp; Such a mixture at country balls or
dinners <a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>passes off very well; but no one in the habit of
drinking the genuine wine can be deceived by the
imposition.&nbsp; The bouquet of real champagne, which is so
peculiar, it is repeated, cannot be imitated&mdash;it is a thing
impossible.&nbsp; Acidity in wine was formerly corrected in this
country by the addition of quicklime, which soon falls to the
bottom of the cask.&nbsp; This furnished a clue to
Falstaff&rsquo;s observation, that there was &lsquo;lime in the
sack,&rsquo; which was a hit at the landlord, as much as to say
his wine was little worth, having its acidity thus
disguised.&nbsp; As to the substances used by various
wine-doctors for flavouring wine, there seems to be no end of
them.&nbsp; Vegetation has been exhausted, and the bowels of the
earth ransacked, to supply trash for this quackery.&nbsp; Wines
under the names of British madeira, port, and sherry are also
made, the basis of which is pale salt, sugar-candy; French brandy
and port-wine are added to favour the deception.&nbsp; So
impudently and notoriously are the frauds avowed, that there are
books published called <i>Publicans&rsquo; Guides</i>, and
<i>Licensed Victuallers&rsquo; Director&rsquo;s</i>, in which the
most infamous receipts imaginable are laid down to swindle their
customers.&nbsp; The various docks on the Thames do not secure
purchasers from the malpractices of dishonest dealers; in this
many are deceived.&nbsp; It has been naturally, yet erroneously,
imagined that wine purchased in the docks must be a pure
article.&nbsp; Malaga sherry is constantly shipped to England for
the real sherry of Xeres, Figueras for port, and so on.&nbsp;
Port-wine being sent from the place of its growth to Guernsey and
Jersey, and there reshipped, <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>with the original quantity tripled
for the English market, the docks are no security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor C. A. Lee, of New York, informs us that &ldquo;a
cheap Madeira is made by extracting the oils from common whisky,
and passing it through carbon.&nbsp; There are immense
establishments in this city where the whisky is thus turned into
wine.&nbsp; In some of those devoted to this branch of business,
the whisky is rolled-in in the evening, but the wine goes out in
the broad daylight, ready to defy the closest inspection.&nbsp; A
grocer, after he had abandoned the nefarious traffic in
adulterations, assured me that he had often purchased whisky one
day of a country merchant, and before he left town sold the same
whisky back to him turned into wine, at a profit of from 400 to
500 per cent.&nbsp; The trade in empty wine-casks in this city
with the Custom-house mark and certificate is immense; the same
casks being replenished again and again, and always accompanied
by that infallible test of genuineness, the Custom-house
certificate.&nbsp; I have heard of a pipe being sold for twelve
dollars.&nbsp; There is in the neighbourhood of New York an
extensive manufactory of wine-casks, which are made so closely to
imitate the foreign as to deceive experienced dealers.&nbsp; The
Custom-house marks are easily counterfeited, and certificates are
never wanting.&nbsp; I have heard,&rdquo; said Dr. Lee,
&ldquo;dealers relate instances in which extensive stores were
filled by these artificial wines; and when merchants from the
country asked for genuine wines, these have been sold them as
such, assuring them there could be no doubt of their
purity.&nbsp; <a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
344</span>It is believed,&rdquo; he observes, &ldquo;that the
annual importation of what is called port-wine into the United
States far exceeds the whole annual produce of the
Alto-Douro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. James Forrester, an extensive grower of wines in the
Alto-Douro and other districts of the north of Portugal, and
another witness, stated that there was a mixture called jeropiga,
composed of two-thirds &lsquo;must,&rsquo; or grape-juice, and
one-third brandy, and which brandy is about twenty per cent above
British brandy-proof, used for bringing up character in
ports.&nbsp; He further declared that sweetening-matter, in every
variety, and elder-berry dye, is administered for the purpose of
colouring it and giving it a body.&nbsp; Moreover, Mr. Forrester
testified that, by the present Portuguese law, <i>no
unsophisticated port-wine is allowed to reach this
country</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any further colouring-matter be
absolutely requisite by the speculator&mdash;I would not suppose
by the merchants (for the merchants generally do not like, unless
they are obliged, to sell very common wines, and do not like to
have recourse to these practices)&mdash;then the elder-berry is,
I believe, the only dye made use of in this country, and <i>costs
an enormous lot of money</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Munroe of Hull, the author of <i>The Physiological Action
of Alcohol</i>, and other scientific works, gives evidence as
follows of the danger attending the use of alcoholic drinks as
medicine:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will relate a circumstance which occurred
to me some years ago, the result of which made a deep <a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>impression
on my mind.&nbsp; I was not then a teetotaler&mdash;would that I
had been!&mdash;but I conscientiously, though erroneously,
believed in the health-restoring properties of stout.&nbsp; A
hard-working, industrious, God-fearing man, a teetotaler of some
years&rsquo; standing, suffering from an abscess in his hand,
which had reduced him very much, applied to me for advice.&nbsp;
I told him the only medicine he required was rest; and to remedy
the waste going on in his system, and to repair the damage done
to his hand, he was to support himself with a bottle of stout
daily.&nbsp; He replied, &lsquo;I cannot take it, for I have been
some years a teetotaler.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;if you know better than the doctor, it is no use applying
to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Believing, as I did then, that the drink
would really be of service to him, I urged him to take the stout
as a medicine, which would not interfere with his pledge.&nbsp;
He looked anxiously in my face, evidently weighing the matter
over in his mind, and sorrowfully replied, &lsquo;Doctor, I was a
drunken man once; I should not like to be one again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was, much against his will, prevailed on to take the
stout, and in time he recovered from his sickness.&nbsp; When he
got well, I of course praised up the virtues of stout as a means
of saving his life, for which he ought ever to be thankful; and
rather lectured him on being such a fanatic (that&rsquo;s the
word) as to refuse taking a bottle of stout daily to restore him
to his former health.&nbsp; I lost sight of my patient for some
months; but I am sorry to say that on one fine summer&rsquo;s
day, when driving through one of our public <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>thoroughfares, I saw a poor, miserable, ragged-looking
man leaning against the door of a common public-house drunk, and
incapable of keeping an erect position.&nbsp; Even in his
poverty, drunkenness, and misery, I discovered it was my teetotal
patient whom I had, not so long ago, persuaded to break his
pledge.&nbsp; I could not be mistaken.&nbsp; I had reason to know
him well, for he had been a member of a Methodist church; an
indefatigable Sunday-school teacher; a prayer-leader whose
earnest appeals for the salvation of others I had often listened
to with pleasure and edification.&nbsp; I immediately went to the
man, and was astonished to find the change which drink in so
short a time had worked in his appearance.&nbsp; With manifest
surprise, and looking earnestly at the poor wretch, I said,
&lsquo;S&mdash;, is that you?&rsquo;&nbsp; With a staggering
reel, and clipping his words, he answered, &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s
me.&nbsp; Look at me again.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I know you,&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;and am grieved to see you in this drunken condition.&nbsp;
I thought you were a teetotaler?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a peculiar grin upon his countenance, he answered,
&lsquo;I was before I took your medicine.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am sorry to see you disgracing yourself by such conduct.&nbsp; I
am ashamed of you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rousing himself, as drunken
people will at times, to extraordinary effort, he scoffingly
replied, &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you send me here for my
medicine?&rsquo; and with a delirious kind of chuckle he
hiccupped out words I shall never forget.&nbsp; &lsquo;Doctor,
your medicine cured my body, but it damned my soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three of his boozing companions, hearing <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>our
conversation, took him under their protection, and I left
him.&nbsp; As I drove away, my heart was full of bitter
reflections, that I had been the cause of ruining this
man&rsquo;s prospects, not only of this world, but of that which
is to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may rest assured I did not sleep much that
night.&nbsp; The drunken aspect of that man haunted me, and I
found myself weeping over the injury I had done him.&nbsp; I rose
up early the next morning and went to his cottage, with its
little garden in front, on the outskirts of the town, where I had
often seen him with his wife and happy children playing about,
but found, to my sorrow, that he had removed some time ago.&nbsp;
At last, with some difficulty, I found him located in a low
neighbourhood, not far distant from the public-house he had
patronised the day before.&nbsp; Here, in such a home as none but
the drunkard could inhabit, I found him laid upon a bed of straw,
feverish and prostrate from the previous day&rsquo;s debauch,
abusing his wife because she could not get him some more
drink.&nbsp; She, standing aloof with tears in her eyes, broken
down with care and grief, her children dirty and clothed in rags,
all friendless and steeped in poverty!&nbsp; What a wreck was
there!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turned out of the church in which he was once an
ornament, his religion sacrificed, his usefulness marred, his
hopes of eternity blasted, now a poor dejected slave to his
passion for drink, without mercy and without hope!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked to him kindly, reasoned with him, succoured <a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>him till he
was well, and never lost sight of him or let him have any peace
until he had signed the <i>pledge</i> again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took him some time to recover his place in the
church; but I have had the happiness of seeing him
restored.&nbsp; He is now more than ever a devoted worker in the
church; and the cause of temperance is pleaded on all
occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you wonder, then, that I never order strong drink
for a patient now?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most terrible results of hard drinking is that kind
of insanity that takes the name of &ldquo;delirium
tremens;&rdquo; and its characteristic symptoms may be described
as follows: Muscular tremors&mdash;more especially of the hands
and of the tongue when protruded&mdash;along with complete
sleeplessness, and delirium of a muttering, sight-seeing,
bustling, abrupt, anxious, apprehensive kind.&nbsp; The afflicted
patient has not the ability to follow out a train of thought, to
explain fully an illusion or perverted sensation, or to perform
any act correctly; for he may be one moment rational and the next
incoherent, now conscious of his real condition and of
surrounding realities, and then again suddenly excited by the
most ridiculous fancies&mdash;principally of a spectral
kind&mdash;such as strange visitors in the shape of human beings,
devils, cats, rats, snakes, &amp;c.; or by alarming occurrences,
such as robberies, fires, pursuits for crimes, and the
like.&nbsp; He is easily pleased and satisfied by gentleness and
indulgence, and much fretted and agitated by restraint and
opposition.&nbsp; The face is generally of a pale dirty colour <a
name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>and wearing
an anxious expression; eyes startled but lustreless, sometimes
considerably suffused, and the pupils not contracted unless
considerable doses of opium have been administered, or very
decided arachnitic symptoms have supervened; skin warm and moist,
often perspiring copiously; tongue sometimes loaded, but
generally pale and moist, occasionally remarkably clean; appetite
small, but the patient will often take whatever is presented to
him; thirst by no means urgent, and seldom or never any craving
for spirituous liquors; urine scanty and high-coloured, and, in
some cases which Dr. Munroe (from whose volume this description
is derived) tested, containing a large quantity of albumen,
which, however, disappears immediately after the paroxysm is
over; alvine evacuations bilious and offensive; and the pulse
generally ranges from 98 to 120, generally soft, but of various
degrees of fulness and smallness, according to the strength of
the patient and the stage of the affection.&nbsp; The precursory
symptoms are by no means peculiar or pathognomonic, but common to
many febrile affections, implicating the sensorium in the way of
repeatedly-disturbed and sleepless nights, with perhaps more of a
hurried and agitated manner than usual for some days
previously.&nbsp; The paroxysm which is distinguished by the
phenomena above described&mdash;occurring with remarkable
uniformity, independently of age and constitution&mdash;usually
runs its course, if uncomplicated and properly treated, on the
second or third day, though sometimes earlier, and it seldom
extends beyond the fifth day.&nbsp; It then terminates <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>in a
profound natural sleep, which may continue for many hours, and
from which, if it even lasts for six hours, the patient awakes
weak and languid, but quite coherent.&nbsp; The casualties of the
disease are convulsions or coma, which, if not immediately fatal,
are apt to leave the sufferer a wreck for the remainder of
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> has recently appeared on the
temperance stage a set of well-meaning gentlemen, who, could they
have their way, though they would sweep every public-house and
beershop from the face of the land, are yet good-natured enough
to meet objectors to their extreme views a &ldquo;third&rdquo; if
not &ldquo;half-way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Wilfred Lawson is the
acknowledged head and champion of the party, and its news on the
all-important subject are summed up in a Permissive Prohibitory
Liquor Bill.&nbsp; It may be mentioned that the said Bill was
rejected in the House of Commons by a very large majority, and is
therefore, for the present, shelved.&nbsp; It stands, however, as
an expression of opinion on the part of eighty-seven members of
parliament, backed by 3,337 petitions, more or less numerously
signed, from various parts of the kingdom, as to what should be
done to <a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>check the advancing curse of drunkenness, and, as such,
its merits may be here discussed.</p>
<p>The Permissive Prohibitory Liquors Bill, as Sir Wilfred Lawson
describes it, provides that no public-houses shall be permitted
in any district, provided that two-thirds of its population agree
that they should be dispensed with.&nbsp; If there are thirty
thousand inhabitants of a parish, and twenty thousand of them
should be of opinion that public-houses are a nuisance that
should be abolished, the remaining ten thousand may grumble, but
they must submit, and either go athirst or betake themselves to
an adjoining and more generous parish.</p>
<p>Sir W. Lawson, in moving the second reading of his Bill, said
&ldquo;that no statistics were needed to convince the House of
Commons of the amount of drunkenness, and consequent poverty and
crime, existing in this country; and even if here and there
drunkenness might be diminishing, that did not affect his
argument, which rested upon the fact that drunkenness in itself
was a fertile and admitted source of evil.&nbsp; The Bill was
called a &lsquo;Permissive Bill;&rsquo; but had the rules of the
House permitted, it might with truth be called a Bill for the
Repression of Pauperism and of Crime.&nbsp; The measure was no
doubt unpopular in the House, but it was a consolation to him
that, although honourable members differed in opinion as to the
efficacy of the remedy proposed, they all sympathised with the
object its promoters had in view.&nbsp; The trouble to which he
feared honourable members had been put during the last few <a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>days in
presenting petitions and answering letters showed the depth and
intensity of the interest taken in the question out of
doors.&nbsp; No less than 3,337 petitions had been presented in
favour of the Bill.&nbsp; It would be remembered that in the
parliament before last a bill similar in its character had been
defeated by an overwhelming majority, all the prominent speakers
in opposition to it at that time declaring that they based their
hopes as to the diminution of drunkenness upon the spread of
education.&nbsp; He agreed in that opinion, but the education, to
be successful, must be of the right sort; and while an army of
schoolmasters and clergyman were engaged in teaching the people
what was good, their efforts, he feared, were greatly
counteracted by that other army of 150,000 publicans and
beersellers encouraging the people to drinking habits.&nbsp; All
these dealers in drink had been licensed and commissioned by the
Government, and were paid by results; they had, consequently, a
direct pecuniary interest in promoting the consumption of as
large an amount of drink as possible.&nbsp; Naturally, if a man
entered into a trade, he wished to do as large a trade as
possible; and he had always felt that the advocates of temperance
did more harm than good in using hard language against the
beersellers, when it was the law which enabled them to engage in
the trade, which was primarily responsible for the
result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The honourable member explained that the Bill did not in any
way interfere with or touch the licensing system as at present
existing; where it was the wish <a name="page354"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 354</span>of the inhabitants that licenses
should be granted, licenses would continue to be granted as at
present.&nbsp; But what the measure sought to do was, to empower
the inhabitants of a neighbourhood, or the great majority of
them, to vote within that neighbourhood the granting of any
licenses at all&mdash;to crystallise public opinion, as it were,
into law.&nbsp; The first objection that had been taken to the
measure was, that it would be impossible to carry out prohibition
in England; but why should that be impossible in this country
which had been successfully carried out in America, in Canada,
and in Nova Scotia?&nbsp; All he had to say upon the revenue
question was, that no amount of revenue to be derived from the
sale of intoxicating drinks should be allowed for a moment to
weigh against the general welfare of the people; and that, if the
present Bill were passed, such a mass of wealth would accumulate
in the pockets of the people, that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer would meet with no difficulty in obtaining ample funds
for carrying on the government of the country.&nbsp; It was
further objected that great inconvenience would be inflicted upon
the minority by the operation of the Bill; but there, again, the
balance of advantage and disadvantage must be looked at, and the
convenience of the few should not be allowed to counterbalance
the benefit that would be conferred upon the great mass of the
people.&nbsp; Then it was said that every year there would be a
great fight upon the question; but was not an annual moral
contest better than nightly physical conflicts at the doors of
the public-houses?&nbsp; The movement in favour of prohibiting <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>the sale of
liquor had proceeded from the poor, and it had been supported by
what he might call the aristocracy of the working-classes.&nbsp;
He asked the House whether it would not be wise, when the future
of this country must be in the hands of the working-classes, to
pay some attention to their demand for a straightforward measure
of this sort, which was intended to put an end to an acknowledged
evil of great magnitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; says the <i>Times</i>, when commenting on
Sir Wilfred Lawson&rsquo;s argument, &ldquo;would it matter to
Sir Wilfred Lawson, or to any of the gentlemen who figure on the
temperance platform, if all the public-houses of their districts
were closed to-morrow?&nbsp; Their own personal comfort would be
in no way affected; not one of them probably enters a
public-house, except at canvassing times, from one year&rsquo;s
end to another.&nbsp; But it would matter a great deal to those
humbler and poorer classes of the population who make daily use
of the public-house.&nbsp; If it were closed, their comfort would
be most materially affected.&nbsp; A large proportion of them use
strong liquor without abusing it, and have therefore as much
right to it, both legal and moral, as they have to their meat or
clothes.&nbsp; Many of them could not get through the work by
which they gain their own and their children&rsquo;s bread
without it; and their only means of procuring it is provided by
the present public-house system.&nbsp; They have not usually
capital enough to lay in for themselves a stock of liquor; and
even if they had, this plan would be not only wasteful and
inconvenient, <a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>but would tempt them to commit the very crime which it
was employed to avoid.&nbsp; They find it both cheaper and more
comfortable to get their liquor in small quantities as they want
it, and they can only do this at a public-house.&nbsp; Besides,
it should not be forgotten&mdash;though well-to-do reformers are
very apt, from their inexperience, to forget it&mdash;that to
many of these poor people living in overcrowded, ill-ventilated,
ill-lighted rooms, the public-house is the only place in which
they can enjoy a quiet evening in pleasant, and perhaps
instructive, intercourse with their neighbours after a hard
day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; To drive them from this genial place of
resort would be in some cases almost as great a hardship as it
would be to the rich man to turn him out of both private house
and club.&nbsp; We shall perhaps be told that all this may be
true, but that the question reduces itself to a choice of evils,
and that, on the whole, much more misery results to the poorer
classes from the use of the public-house than would result if
they were deprived of it.&nbsp; But, even if we grant this for
the sake of argument, it seems to us strangely unjust to debar
one man forcibly from a privilege at once pleasant and profitable
to him, simply because another abuses it.&nbsp; The injustice,
too, is greatly heightened by the fact that those who take the
most prominent and influential part in debarring him feel nothing
of the suffering they inflict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Sir Wilfred Lawson in the House of Commons came Mr.
Besley, who declared that something like one hundred millions
sterling was annually <a name="page357"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 357</span>expended in this country in
intoxicating drinks; and in our prisons, our lunatic asylums, and
our workhouses, large numbers of the victims of intemperate
indulgence in those drinks were always to be found.&nbsp; Mr.
Besley believed that the present mode of restricting the sale of
liquors was anything but a satisfactory one.&nbsp; In this
respect the people would be the best judges of their own
wants&mdash;of what their own families and their own
neighbourhoods required; and he believed that if the decision was
placed in their hands, as it would be by this Bill, the evils of
intoxication would be very much mitigated.&nbsp; He did not
entertain the hope that we should ever make people sober by Act
of Parliament, but he did believe that it was in the power of the
Legislature to diminish the evil to a very great extent.&nbsp;
Supposing the expenditure on intoxicating drinks were reduced
one-half, how usefully might not the fifty millions thus saved be
employed in the interests of the poor themselves!&nbsp; He
believed that dwellings for the poor would be among the first
works undertaken with that money.&nbsp; For fifty millions they
might erect 250,000 dwellings, costing 200<i>l.</i> each, and
this was an expenditure which would cause an increased demand for
labour in a variety of trades.</p>
<p>I cannot do better than wind up these brief extracts by
reproducing the loudly-applauded objections of the Home
Secretary, Mr. Bruce, to the Permissive Prohibitory Liquor
Bill.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The most complete remedy for drunkenness
was to be found in the cultivation among the people of a <a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>better
appreciation of their own interests, rather than in
legislation.&nbsp; This had undoubtedly been the cause of the
almost complete disappearance of drunkenness among the upper
classes, coupled with an increased desire for and consequent
supply of intellectual amusement among them.&nbsp; But, although
education in its largest sense was the true remedy for
drunkenness, there was no reason against the introduction of
repressive or preventive measures in behalf of those in our
manufacturing districts, especially that large class irregularly
employed and often oscillating between starvation and occasional
well-doing, to whom drunkenness was a refuge from despair.&nbsp;
The question was, in whom should the power of restriction be
reposed?&nbsp; Some thought in the resident ratepayers, others in
the magistrates, and others in a body elected for the
purpose.&nbsp; He could not say which proposal should be adopted,
but confessed that there was some reason in the demand, that the
number of public-houses should be uniformly regulated according
to the population.&nbsp; He had been asked whether he would
undertake to deal with the matter.&nbsp; To deal with the matter
in the manner proposed by the honourable baronet would at once
deprive some portion of the people of means of enjoyment, and the
owners of public-houses of their property.&nbsp; That would be a
proceeding unnecessary and unjust, because, although the admitted
evils of drunkenness were very grievous, there was no doubt that
public-houses, especially when well managed, really did furnish
to a large portion of the people a means of social comfort and
enjoyment.&nbsp; <a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
359</span>His objection to the Bill was, that it would not only
cause a great deal of disturbance in many parts of the country,
but would almost inevitably cause riot.&nbsp; Certainly the
rigorous treatment proposed by the Bill was unsuited to people
whose only pleasures were sensuous.&nbsp; The honourable member
proposed that a majority of two-thirds of the ratepayers of a
borough should be able to put the Bill in operation; but in this
proposal he ignored a large proportion of those most
interested.&nbsp; Two-thirds of the ratepayers left much more
than one-third of the population on the other side, and the more
important portion of the population as regards this matter,
because it was made up in a great measure by those who lived in
all the discomfort of lodgings.&nbsp; Again, it was suggested
that the settlement of the question might in each case be left to
a majority of the population; but here, again, it might be said
that the question would probably be decided by a majority of
persons least interested in the question&mdash;interested, that
was, only as regards peace and order, and careless how far the
humbler classes of society were deprived of their pleasure.&nbsp;
What the Legislature had to do was, not to deprive the people of
means of innocent enjoyment, but to prevent that means being used
to foster crime and gross self-indulgence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However much one might feel disposed, in the main, to agree
with Sir Wilfred Lawson and his colleagues, it is not easy to
grant him the position he assumes at the commencement of his
argument, that &ldquo;statistics are unnecessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is a singular fact, and one that <a name="page360"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>everyone taking an interest in the
great and important question of the drunkenness of the nation
must have noticed, that amongst the advocates of total-abstinence
principles &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; invariably are regarded as
&ldquo;unnecessary.&rdquo;&nbsp; This undoubtedly is a grave
mistake, and one more likely than any other to cast a deeper
shade of distrust over the minds of doubters.&nbsp; It would seem
either that the great evil in question is so difficult of access
in its various ramifications as to defy the efforts of the
statistician, or else that total abstainers, as a body, are
imbued with the conviction that the disasters arising from the
consumption of intoxicating drinks are so enormous, and
widespread, and universally acknowledged, that it would be a mere
waste of time to bring forward figures in proof.&nbsp; Perhaps,
again, the drunkard is such a very unsavoury subject, that the
upright water-drinker, pure alike in mind and body, has a
repugnance to so close a handling of him.&nbsp; If this last
forms any part of the reason why the question of beer-drinking
<i>v.</i> water-drinking should not be laid before us as fairly
and fully as two and two can make it, the objectors may be
referred to social subjects of a much more repulsive kind,
concerning which many noble and large-hearted gentlemen
courageously busy themselves, and studiously inquire into, with a
view to representing them exactly as they are discovered.&nbsp;
In proof of this, the reader is referred to the sections of this
book that are devoted to the consideration of Professional
Thieves, and of Fallen Women.</p>
<p>There can be no question that, in a matter that so <a
name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>nearly
affects the domestic economy of a people, statistics are not only
necessary but indispensable.&nbsp; No man&rsquo;s word should be
taken for granted, where so much that is important is
involved.&nbsp; The man may be mistaken; but there is no getting
away from figures.&nbsp; A man, in his righteous enthusiasm, may
exaggerate even, but a square old-fashioned 4 can never be
exaggerated into a 5, or a positive 1 be so twisted by plausible
argument as to falsely represent 2.&nbsp; Yet, somehow, those who
urge even so complete a revolution in the ancient and sociable
habit of drinking as to make it dependent on the will of Brown
and Robinson whether their neighbour Jones shall partake of a
pint of beer out of the publican&rsquo;s bright pewter, afford us
no figures in support of their extreme views.</p>
<p>Nor is this deficiency observable only in those unaccustomed
persons who mount the platform to make verbal statements, and
with whom the handling of large and complicated numbers might be
found inconvenient.&nbsp; Practised writers on teetotalism
exhibit the same carelessness.&nbsp; I have before me at the
present moment a goodly number of total-abstinence volumes, but
not one furnishes the desired information.&nbsp; Among my books I
find, first, John Gough&rsquo;s <i>Orations</i>; but that able
and fervent man, although he quotes by the score instances and
examples that are enough to freeze the blood and make the hair
stand on end of the horrors that arise from indulgence in
alcoholic drinks, deals not in statistics.&nbsp; Dr. James Miller
writes an excellent treatise on alcohol and its power; but he <a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>deals in
generalities, and not in facts that figures authenticate.&nbsp;
Here is a volume containing a <i>Thousand Temperance Facts and
Anecdotes</i>; but in the whole thousand, not one of either tells
us of how many customers, on a certain evening, visited a single
and well-used public-house, went in sober, and came out palpably
drunk.&nbsp; It would be coming to the point, if such
information&mdash;quite easy to obtain&mdash;was set before
us.&nbsp; Lastly, I have the <i>Temperance
Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>.&nbsp; Now, I thought, I am sure, in some
shape or another, to find here what I seek; but I searched in
vain.&nbsp; The volume in question is a bulky volume, and
contains about seven hundred pages, in small close type.&nbsp; In
it you may read all about the physical nature of intemperance,
and the intellectual nature of intemperance, and of the diseases
produced by the use of alcohol, and of the progress of
intemperance amongst the ancient Greeks and Romans, together with
the history and origin of the teetotal cause in America; but as
to the number of drunkards brought before the magistrates and
fined, or of the number of crimes shown at the time of trial to
have been committed through drunkenness, the
<i>Cyclop&aelig;dia</i> is dumb.&nbsp; This last is an oversight
the more to be deplored because we very well know that if the
said numbers were exhibited, they would make a very startling
display.&nbsp; It may be urged that, since we already have the
testimony of magistrates, and jail-governors, and judges, of the
enormous amount of crime that is attributable to strong drinks,
it is unreasonable to ask for more; but this objection <a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>may be
fairly met by the answer, that magistrates themselves, even when
discussing the temperance question, occasionally make
unreasonable remarks; as did a metropolitan magistrate the other
day, who in open court declared, that &ldquo;if publicans were
compelled to shut up their shops, there would be no further use
for his.&rdquo;&nbsp; He must have known better.&nbsp; If it were
as the worthy magistrate stated, it was equivalent to saying that
teetotalers never appeared at his bar; but I think that he would
hardly have ventured to that length.</p>
<p>In my belief, it is the tremendous steam and effervescence of
language indulged in by the advocates of total abstinence that
keeps them from making more headway.&nbsp; The facts they give
us, like the drunkard&rsquo;s grog, are generally &ldquo;hot and
strong,&rdquo; though with very, <i>very</i> little of the sugar
of forbearance.&nbsp; I find, for instance, in the temperance
records before me, frequent allusion to the great number of
drunkards who nightly are thrown out at the doors of
public-houses where they have been passing the evening, and left
to wallow in the kennel.&nbsp; Not only do we read of this in
books, we have it from the mouths of preachers in the pulpit, and
speakers on public platforms and in temperance
lecture-halls.&nbsp; But I venture to declare that whoever
believes anything of the kind, believes what is not true.&nbsp;
Every man has a right to speak according to his experience; and I
speak from mine.&nbsp; I think that I may lay claim to as
extensive a knowledge of the ways of London&mdash;especially the
bye and ugly ways&mdash;as almost any man; and I can positively
say that it has never once been my <a name="page364"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 364</span>lot to witness the throwing
(&ldquo;throwing&rdquo; is the expression) of a man from a
public-house-door, followed by his helpless wallowing in the
kennel.&nbsp; What is more, it was by no means necessary for me
to witness such a hideous and disgusting spectacle to convince me
of the evils of intemperance, and of how necessary it was to
reform the existing laws as applying to the reckless granting of
licenses in certain neighbourhoods.&nbsp; It is quite enough,
more than enough, to satisfy me of what a terrible curse a
bestial indulgence in gin and beer is, when I see a human
creature turned helpless from the public-house, and left to
stagger home as he best may.&nbsp; To my eyes, he is then no
better than a pig; and if he took to wallowing in the gutter, it
would be no more than one might expect; but he does <i>not</i>
&ldquo;wallow in the gutter;&rdquo; and it is not necessary to
picture him in that wretched predicament in order to bring home
to the decent mind how terrible a bane strong drink is, or to
shock the man already inclined to inebriation into at once
rushing off to a teetotal club and signing the pledge.</p>
<p>And now I must be permitted to remark that no man more than
myself can have a higher appreciation of the efforts of those who
make it the duty of their lives to mitigate the curse of
drunkenness.&nbsp; What vexes me is, the wrong-headed, and not
unfrequently the weak and ineffectual, way in which they set
about it.&nbsp; As I view the matter, the object of the preacher
of total abstinence is not so much the reclamation of the
drunkard already steeped and sodden, as the deterring from
reckless <a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
365</span>indulgence those who are not averse to stimulative
liquors, but are by no means drunkards.&nbsp; Therefore they
appeal as a rule to men who are in the enjoyment of their sober
senses, and in a condition to weigh with a steady mind the
arguments that are brought forward to induce them to abandon
alcoholic stimulants altogether.&nbsp; Now, it must be plain to
these latter&mdash;sound-headed men, who drink beer, not because
they are anxious to experience the peculiar sensations of
intoxication, but because they conscientiously believe that they
are the better for drinking it&mdash;it must be evident to these
that teetotal triumphs, exhibited in the shape of converted
drunkards, are at best but shallow affairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any port
in a storm,&rdquo; is the wrecked mariner&rsquo;s motto; and no
doubt the wretched drunkard, with his poor gin-rotted liver, and
his palsied limbs, and his failing brain, with perhaps a touch of
<i>delirium tremens</i> to spur him on, might be glad, indeed, to
escape to a teetotal harbour of refuge; and it is not to be
wondered at, if, reclaimed from the life of a beast and restored
to humanity, he rejoices, and is anxious to publish aloud the
glad story of his redemption.&nbsp; As a means of convincing the
working man of the wrong he commits in drinking a pint of
fourpenny, the upholder of total-abstinence principles delights
to bring forth his &ldquo;brand from the burning&rdquo;&mdash;the
reclaimed drunkard&mdash;and get him, with a glibness that
repetition insures, to detail the particulars of his previous
horrible existence&mdash;how he drank, how he swore, how he
blasphemed, how he broke up his home, and brutally ill-treated
his wife and children.&nbsp; All this, that <a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>he may
presently arrive at the climax, and say, &ldquo;This I have been,
and <i>now</i> look at me!&nbsp; I have a black coat instead of a
ragged fustian jacket; my shirt-collar is whiter and more rigid
in its purity even than your own.&nbsp; See what teetotalism has
done for me, and adopt the course I adopted, and sign the
pledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the indulger in moderate and honest four-penny
replies, &ldquo;I see exactly what teetotalism has done for you,
and you can&rsquo;t be too grateful for it; but there is no
demand for it to do so much for me.&nbsp; If I was afire, as you
say that you once were, and blazing in the consuming flames of
drunkenness,&mdash;to use your own powerful language&mdash;no
doubt I should be as glad as you were to leap into the first
water-tank that presented itself.&nbsp; But I am not blazing and
consuming.&nbsp; I am no more than comfortably warm under the
influence of the pint of beer I have just partaken of; and though
I am glad indeed to see <i>you</i> in the tank, if you have no
objection, I will for the present keep outside of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, from the tone adopted by certain total-abstinence
professors, people who are compelled to take such matters on
hearsay&mdash;the very people, by the way, who would be most
likely, &ldquo;for his good,&rdquo; to join the majority of
two-thirds that is to shut up taverns&mdash;would be made to
believe that those who frequent the public-house are drunkards as
a rule; that though occasionally a few, who have not at present
dipped very deep in the hideous vice, may be discovered in the
parlour and the taproom bemusing themselves over their beer, the
tavern is essentially the resort of the man whose <a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>deliberate
aim and intention is to drink until be is tipsy, and who does do
so.&nbsp; The moderate man&mdash;the individual who is in the
habit of adjourning to the decent tavern-parlour, which is his
&ldquo;club,&rdquo; to pass away an hour before supper-time with
a pipe and a pint of ale and harmless chat with his
friends&mdash;is well aware of this exaggerated view of his
doings; and it is hardly calculated to soften his heart towards
those who would &ldquo;reform&rdquo; him, or incline him to
listen with any amount of patience to their arguments.&nbsp; He
feels indignant, knowing the imputation to be untrue.&nbsp; He is
not a drunkard, and he has no sympathy with drunkards.&nbsp; Nay,
he would be as forward as his teetotal detractor, and quite as
earnest, in persuading the wretched reckless swiller of beer and
gin to renounce his bestial habit.&nbsp; It is a pity that so
much misunderstanding and misrepresentation should exist on so
important a feature of the matter in debate, when, with so little
trouble, it might be set at rest.&nbsp; If public-houses are an
evil, it must be mainly because the indolent and the sensual
resort thither habitually for convenience of drinking until they
are drunk.&nbsp; Is this so?&nbsp; I have no hesitation in saying
that in the vast majority of cases it is not.&nbsp; The question
might easily be brought to the test; and why has it not been
done?&nbsp; Let a hundred public-houses in the metropolis be
selected at random, and as many impartial and trustworthy men be
deputed to keep watch on the said public-houses every night for a
week.&nbsp; Let them make note particularly of those who are not
dram-drinkers, but who go to the public-house <a
name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 368</span>for the
purpose of passing an hour or so there; let them mark their
demeanour when they enter and again when they emerge; and I have
no doubt that, by a large majority, the working man in search
simply of an hour&rsquo;s evening amusement and sociable society
will be acquitted of anything approaching sottishness, or such an
inclination towards mere tipsiness even, as calls for the
intervention of the Legislature.</p>
<p>And now, while we are on the subject of statistics, and the
peculiar influences it is the custom of the total abstainer to
bring to bear against his erring brother the moderate drinker, I
may mention what appears to me the highly objectionable practice
of enlisting the cooperation of boys and girls&mdash;mere little
children&mdash;in the interest of their cause.&nbsp; In the
parliamentary discussion on the Permissive Prohibitory Liquor
Bill, Colonel Jervis remarked, on the subject of the 3,337
petitions that were presented in its support: &ldquo;I do not
know whether the petitions that have been presented in its favour
are properly signed; but certainly I have seen attached to one of
those petitions which come from my neighbourhood names that I do
not recognise.&nbsp; The signatures might, perhaps, be those of
Sunday-school children; but I do not think that petitions from
children should carry a Bill of this kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Were it
any other business but teetotal business, one might feel disposed
to pass by as meaningless the hint conveyed in Colonel
Jervis&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; None but those, however, who are
conversant with the strange methods total abstainers will adopt
to gain their ends <a name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
369</span>will be inclined to attach some weight to them.&nbsp;
The children are a weapon of great strength in the hands of the
teetotal.&nbsp; Almost as soon as they begin to lisp, they are
taught sentences condemnatory of the evils that arise from an
indulgence in strong drink; soon as they are able to write, their
names appear on the voluminous roll of total abstainers.&nbsp; At
their feasts and picnics they carry banners, on which is
inscribed their determination to refrain from what they have
never tasted; and over their sandwiches Tommy Tucker, in his
first breeches, pledges Goody Twoshoes in a glass from the
crystal spring, and expresses his intention of dying as he has
lived&mdash;a total abstainer.&nbsp; I am not a bachelor, but a
man long married, and with a &ldquo;troop of little children at
my knee,&rdquo; as numerous, perhaps, as that which gathered
about that of &ldquo;John Brown,&rdquo; immortalised in
song.&nbsp; But I must confess that I do chafe against children
of a teetotal tendency one occasionally is introduced to.&nbsp; I
have before made allusion to a recently-published volume entitled
<i>A Thousand Temperance Facts and Anecdotes</i>.&nbsp; This is
the title given on the cover; the title-page, however, more
liberally reveals the nature of its contents.&nbsp; Thereon is
inscribed, &ldquo;One Thousand Temperance Anecdotes, Facts,
Jokes, Biddies, Puns, and Smart Sayings; suitable for Speakers,
Penny Readings, Recitations, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, to be
sure, it is not in the least objectionable that the teetotaler
should have his &ldquo;comic reciter;&rdquo; nor can there be a
question as to the possibility of being as funny, as hilarious
even, over a cup of wholesome, harmless <a
name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>tea as over
the grog-glass.&nbsp; But I very much doubt if any but total
abstainers could appreciate some of the witticisms that,
according to the book in question, occasionally issue from the
mouths of babes and sucklings.&nbsp; Here is a sample:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">Child&rsquo;s
Acumen</span>.&mdash;&lsquo;Pa, does wine make a beast of a
man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pshaw, child, only once in a while!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that the reason why Mr. Goggins has on his
sign&mdash;Entertainment for man and beast?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, child, what makes you ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because ma says that last night you went to
Goggins&rsquo;s <i>a man</i>, and came back <i>a beast</i>! and
that he entertained you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s nonsense, dear!&nbsp; Run
out and play; papa&rsquo;s head aches!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may have a preposterous aversion to a development of
cuteness of a certain sort in children, but I must confess that
it would not have pained me much had the above brilliant little
anecdote concluded with a reference to something else being made
to ache besides papa&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Again: &ldquo;Two little boys attended a temperance meeting at
Otley in Yorkshire, and signed a pledge that they should not
touch nor give strong drink to anyone.&nbsp; On going home, their
father ordered them to fetch some ale, and gave them a can for
the purpose.&nbsp; They obeyed; but after getting the ale neither
of them felt inclined to carry it; so they puzzled themselves as
to what they could do.&nbsp; At last they hit upon an <a
name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
371</span>expedient.&nbsp; A long broom-handle was procured, and
slinging the can on this, each took one end of the broom-handle,
and so conveyed the liquor home without spilling it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One realty cannot see what moral lesson is to be deduced from
these two &ldquo;funny&rdquo; teetotal stories, unless it is
intended to show that, from the lofty eminence of total
abstinence, a child may with impunity look down upon and
&ldquo;chaff&rdquo; and despise his beer-drinking parent.&nbsp;
It would rather seem that too early an indulgence in teetotal
principles is apt to have an effect on the childish mind quite
the reverse of humanising.&nbsp; Here is still another instance
quoted from the &ldquo;smart-saying&rdquo; pages:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Two poor little children attending a school
in America, at some distance from their home, were shunned by the
others because their father was a drunkard.&nbsp; The remainder
at dinner-time went into the playground and ate their dinner; but
the poor twins could only look on.&nbsp; If they approached near
those who were eating, the latter would say, &lsquo;You go away;
your father is a drunkard.&rsquo;&nbsp; But they were soon taught
to behave otherwise; and then it was gratifying to see how
delicate they were in their attention to the two little
unfortunates.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If such contemptible twaddle enters very largely into the
educational nourishment provided for the young abstainer, we may
tremble for the next generation of our beer-imbibing
species.&nbsp; It appears, moreover, that those doughty
juveniles, when they are well trained, <a
name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 372</span>will
fearlessly tackle the enemy, alcohol, even when he is found
fortified within an adult being; and very often with an amount of
success that seems <i>almost</i> incredible.&nbsp; However, the
veracious little book of temperance anecdotes vouches for it, and
no more can be said.&nbsp; Here following is an affecting
instance of how, &ldquo;once upon a time,&rdquo; a band of small
teetotal female infants were the means of converting from the
error of his ways a full-blown drunkard:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We used to furnish little boys and girls
with pledge-books and pencils, and thus equipped, they got us
numerous signatures.&nbsp; A man was leaning, much intoxicated,
against a tree.&nbsp; Some little girls coming from school saw
him there, and at once said to each other, &lsquo;What shall we
do for him?&rsquo;&nbsp; Presently one said, &lsquo;O, I&rsquo;ll
tell you: let&rsquo;s sing him a temperance song.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And so they did.&nbsp; They collected round him, and struck up,
&lsquo;Away, away with the bowl!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so on, in
beautiful tones.&nbsp; The poor drunkard liked it, and so would
you.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sing again, my little girls,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;We will,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;if you will
sign the temperance pledge.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;we are not at a temperance meeting; besides,
you&rsquo;ve no pledges with you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, we
have, and pencils too;&rsquo; and they held them up to him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t sign now; but do sing to
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; So they sang again, &lsquo;The drink
that&rsquo;s in the drunkard&rsquo;s bowl is not the drink for
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;O, do sing again!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
But they were firm this time, and declared they would go away if
he did not sign.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said the poor fellow,
striving to find an excuse, <a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve no table.&nbsp;
How can I write without a table?&rsquo;&nbsp; At this one quiet,
modest, pretty little creature came up timidly, with one finger
on her lips, and said, &lsquo;You can write upon your hat, while
we hold it for you.&rsquo;&nbsp; The man signed; and he narrated
these facts before 1,500 children, saying, &lsquo;Thank God for
those children!&mdash;they came to me as messengers of
mercy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is to be hoped this affecting, not to say romantic, episode
in the history of &ldquo;conversions,&rdquo; will not be so
lightly read that its chief beauties will be missed.&nbsp; It
presents a picture full of the loveliest &ldquo;bits&rdquo; that
to be thoroughly enjoyed should be lingered over.&nbsp; First of
all, let us take the drunkard, too &ldquo;far gone&rdquo; for
locomotion, leaning &ldquo;against a tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; Leaning
against a tree, with an idiotic leer on his flushed and tipsy
face, and maybe trying to recall to his bemuddled memory the
burden of the drinking-song that he recently heard and
participated in in the parlour of the village alehouse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What shall we do with him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O,
I&rsquo;ll tell you: let us sing him a temperance
song.&rdquo;&nbsp; There you have a prime bit of the picture
complete.&nbsp; The sot with his back to the tree, the swaying
green boughs of which have tilted his battered hat over his left
eye, and the band of little girls gathered in a semicircle about
him, and rousing him to consciousness by the first thrilling note
of &ldquo;Away, away with the bowl!&rdquo;&nbsp; The words sound
as though they would go best with a hunting-tune, a sort of
&ldquo;Heigh-ho, tantivy!&rdquo; and one can imagine the
intoxicated one first of all mistaking it for that roistering
melody, and gently snapping <a name="page374"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 374</span>his thumbs at it, he being for the
present somewhat hampered as regards his vocal abilities.&nbsp;
One can imagine him chuckling tipsily and snapping his
thumbs&mdash;feebler and still more feeble as he discovers his
error.&nbsp; It is <i>not</i> a hunting-song; it is a temperance
ditty of the first, the purest water!&nbsp; His heart is
touched.&nbsp; His now disengaged thumbs seek the corners of his
eyes, and the scalding tears steal shimmering down his red-hot
nose!&nbsp; &ldquo;Sing&mdash;sing it again!&rdquo; he
gasps.&nbsp; But no; the artless chanters have gained a step, and
they mean to retain it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not till you sign the
pledge,&rdquo; say they.&nbsp; However, he begs so hard that they
concede to the extent of a verse and a half.&nbsp; Still he is
obdurate; but he gradually yields, till, driven into a corner, he
falters, &ldquo;But you have no table.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then comes
the crowning triumph of the picture&mdash;the incident of the
hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can write upon your hat&mdash;we will hold
it for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the deed was done!</p>
<p>The same volume reveals another story of so similar a kind
that it would almost seem that the children of the first story
had confided their miraculous experience to the children of the
second story.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">Crystal-Palace
Incident</span>.&mdash;The following pleasing incident was
related to me by a youthful member of the choir, at the recent
Crystal-Palace <i>f&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp; It seems that some of the
young choristers were amusing themselves in the grounds, and saw
a poor man lying on the grass partially intoxicated.&nbsp; Their
medals attracted his attention, and he began to dispute the
motto, &ldquo;Wine is a mocker.&rdquo;&nbsp; This led to
conversation, and the children <a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>endeavoured to induce him to become
an abstainer, and sang several melodies.&nbsp; One of the
conductors was also present.&nbsp; The man seemed much affected
during the singing, and cried, my young informant said, until he
was quite sober.&nbsp; He confessed that he had once been a
teetotaler for three years, during which time he had been much
benefited; but had broken his pledge through the influence of his
companions.&nbsp; However, he was happily prevailed upon to sign
again, and to put down his name in a pledge-book at hand, and
before they separated he thanked the young people heartily,
saying, &lsquo;I did not come here expecting to sign the
pledge.&nbsp; I shall now be able to go home to my wife and
children and tell them; and to-morrow I shall be able to go to my
work, instead of being at the public-house.&rsquo;&nbsp; What a
blessing it may prove to that wife and family should the poor man
keep to his resolution!&nbsp; Let no child despair of doing
something towards reclaiming the drunkard, but let all endeavour,
by loving, gentle persuasion whenever opportunity offers, to help
to make the wretched drunkard blessed by living
soberly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should be sorry indeed to &ldquo;make fun&rdquo; of any
attempt earnestly and heartily made by anyone for a
fellow-creature&rsquo;s good, but really there is so much that is
of questionable sincerity in such effusions as those above
quoted, that one feels by no means sure it is not intended as a
joke.&nbsp; Just, for instance, take that one feature of the
drunkard &ldquo;lying on the grass,&rdquo; and &ldquo;crying
himself sober,&rdquo; while, led by their conductor, <a
name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>the
youthful members of the choir sang him all the songs they
knew!&nbsp; Such a scene would make the fortune of a farce with
Mr. Toole to play the tipsy man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> can be no doubt that the vice
of gambling is on the increase amongst the English
working-classes.&nbsp; Of this no better proof is afforded than
in the modern multiplication of those newspapers specially
devoted to matters &ldquo;sportive.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twenty years ago
there were but three or four sporting newspapers published in
London; now there are more than a dozen.&nbsp; It would, however,
be unfair to regard the rapid growth of these questionable prints
as an undoubted symptom of the deepening depravity of the
masses.&nbsp; The fact is this: that though the national passion
for gambling, for betting, and wagering, and the excitement of
seeing this or that &ldquo;event&rdquo; decided, has increased of
late, it is chiefly because <a name="page378"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 378</span>the people have much more leisure
now than of yore.&nbsp; They must have amusement for their
disengaged hours, and they naturally seek that for which they
have the greatest liking.</p>
<p>It is a comforting reflection, however, that in their sports
and pastimes Englishmen, and especially Londoners, of the present
generation, are less barbarous than those of the last.&nbsp;
Setting horse-racing aside, anyone who now takes up for perusal
the ordinary penny sporting paper will find therein nothing more
repugnant to his sensibilities, as regards human performers, than
records of swimming, and cricket, and running, and walking, and
leaping; and as regards four-footed creatures, the discourse will
be of dogs &ldquo;coursing&rdquo; or racing, or killing rats in a
pit.&nbsp; In the present enlightened age we do not fight cocks
and &ldquo;shy&rdquo; at hens tied to a stake at the
Shrove-Tuesday fair; neither do we fight dogs, or pit those
sagacious creatures to bait bulls.&nbsp; In a newspaper before
me, not a quarter of a century old, there is a minute and graphic
account of a bull-baiting, at which in the pride of his heart the
owner of a bull-dog did a thing that in the present day would
insure for him twelve months of hard labour on the treadmill, but
which in the &ldquo;good old time&rdquo; was merely regarded as
the act of a spirited sportsman.&nbsp; A white bull-dog,
&ldquo;Spurt&rdquo; by name, had performed prodigies of valour
against a bear brought before him and before a crowded
audience.&nbsp; Finally, however, the exhausted creature bungled
in a delicate act of the performance, and those who had bet
against the dog exasperated its master by clapping their
hands.&nbsp; <a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
379</span>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think that he can&rsquo;t do
it?&rdquo; roared the dog&rsquo;s owner; &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;ll
take ten to one in twenties that he does it on three
legs&mdash;with one foot chopped off.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; somebody cried.&nbsp; Whereon the valiant
bulldog owner called for a cleaver, and setting the left fore-paw
of his faithful dog on the ledge of the pit, he hacked it off at
a blow.&nbsp; Then instantly he urged the creature at the bear
again, and, raging with pain, it at once sprang at its shaggy
opponent and pinned it.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that occasionally there still appears in
the sporting newspapers some brief account of a
&ldquo;mill&rdquo; that has recently taken place between those
once highly-popular gentlemen&mdash;the members of the
&ldquo;P.R.&rdquo;&nbsp; But public interest in this department
of &ldquo;sport&rdquo; is fast dying out; and not one reader in a
hundred would care to wade through column after column of an
account of how the Brompton Bison smashed the snout of the
Bermondsey Pet; and how the latter finally gained the victory by
battering his opponent&rsquo;s eyes until he was blind and
&ldquo;came up groggy,&rdquo; and could not even see his man, let
alone avoid the sledgehammer blows that were still pounding his
unhappy ribs.&nbsp; There are left very few indeed of those
individuals who, as &ldquo;sportsmen,&rdquo; admire
Raw-Head-and-Bloody-Bones as master of the ceremonies.</p>
<p>All the while, however, it is to be feared that the sporting
newspaper of the present day reveals the existence of really more
mischief, more substantial immorality and rascality than ever
appeared in their pages before.&nbsp; As a quarter of a century
since pugilism was the <a name="page380"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 380</span>main feature with the sporting
press, now it is horse-racing; not for its sake, but for the
convenient peg it affords to hang a bet on.&nbsp; It may be
safely asserted that among Londoners not one in five hundred
could mention the chief qualities a racer should possess; but
this goes for nothing; or perhaps it might be said that it goes
for everything.&nbsp; It is each man&rsquo;s faith in the
ignorance of his neighbour, and his high respect for his own
sagacity and his &ldquo;good luck,&rdquo; wherein resides the
secret of the horse-betting mania at the present time afflicting
the nation.</p>
<p>As the reader will have remarked, so rapidly has the disease
in question spread during the past few years that Government has
at last thought fit to interpose the saving arm of the law
between the victim and the victimiser.&nbsp; Numerous as are the
sporting papers, and to the last degree accommodating in acting
as mediums of communication between the ignorant people who stand
in need of horsey counsel and the &ldquo;knowing ones&rdquo; of
the turf who, for a small consideration, are ever ready to give
it, it was discovered by certain bold schemers that a yet wider
field of operation was as yet uncultivated.&nbsp; To be sure,
what these bold adventurers meditated was contrary to law, and of
that they were well aware, and at first acted on the careful
Scotch maxim of not putting out their hand farther than at a
short notice they could draw it back again.&nbsp; Success,
however, made them audacious.&nbsp; Either the law slept, or else
it indolently saw what they were up to and winked, till at last,
growing each week more courageous, the new <a
name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>gambling
idea, that took the name of &ldquo;Spec,&rdquo; became of
gigantic dimensions.</p>
<p>Throughout lower London, and the shady portions of its
suburbs, the window of almost every public-house and beer-shop
was spotted with some notice of these &ldquo;Specs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There were dozens of them.&nbsp; There were the &ldquo;Deptford
Spec,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Lambeth Spec,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Great Northern Spec,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Derby
Spec;&rdquo; but they all meant one and the same thing&mdash;a
lottery, conducted on principles more or less honest, the prize
to be awarded according to the performances of certain
racehorses.&nbsp; All on a sudden, however, the officers of the
law swooped down on the gambling band, and carried them, bag and
baggage, before a magistrate to answer for their delinquency.</p>
<p>At the examination of the first batch at Bow-street, as well
as at their trial, much curious information was elicited.&nbsp;
It appeared that the originator of the scheme lived at Deptford,
and that he had pursued it for so long as six or seven years.</p>
<p>The drawings were on Saturday nights, when the great majority
of the working-people had received their wages, and when, it
having been noised abroad that these lotteries were going on,
they were likely to attend and to expend their money in the
purchase of such of the tickets as had not been sold already.</p>
<p>If all the tickets were not sold, a portion of each prize was
deducted, and the holders of prizes were paid in proportion to
the number of tickets that were sold; and, as it was impossible
to know what number of <a name="page382"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 382</span>tickets had actually been sold, it
could not be determined whether the distribution had or had not
been carried out with fairness, or how much had been deducted to
pay for expenses, and to afford a profit to the promoters of the
concern.&nbsp; Several cabloads of tickets, result-sheets,
&amp;c. were seized at the residences of the managers of the
&ldquo;spec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were numerous &ldquo;partners&rdquo; in the firm, and
they were frequently at the chief&rsquo;s residence, and were
instrumental in carrying out the lotteries.&nbsp; One or other
was always present at the drawing of the numbers and at the
distribution of the prizes.&nbsp; One partner was a stationer in
the Strand, and at his shop were sold the tickets for these
lotteries, and also what are termed the
&ldquo;result-sheets,&rdquo; which were sold at one penny each,
and each of which contained the results of a &ldquo;draw,&rdquo;
setting forth which of the ticket-holders had been fortunate
enough to draw the several prizes, and also advertising the next
&ldquo;spec&rdquo; or lottery.&nbsp; Each of these
&ldquo;specs&rdquo; related to a particular race, and the tickets
were substantially alike.&nbsp; Each had on the top the words
&ldquo;Deptford Spec,&rdquo; with a number and letter, and in the
corner the name of a race, as &ldquo;Newmarket Handicap
Sweep,&rdquo; &ldquo;Liverpool Grand National
Steeplechase.&rdquo;&nbsp; In each of these there were 60,000
subscribers, and in that for the Thousand Guineas 75,000.&nbsp;
The prizes varied in proportion; but in one they were &pound;500
for the first horse, &pound;300 for the second, and &pound;150
for the third.&nbsp; Among the starters was to be divided
&pound;500, and among the non-starters &pound;600.&nbsp; There
were also 200 prizes of <a name="page383"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 383</span>&pound;1, and 300 prizes of
10<i>s.</i>&nbsp; It was stated on the tickets that the prizes
would go with the stakes, and that the result-sheets would be
published on the Monday after the draw.&nbsp; There was also a
stipulation that, in the event of any dispute arising, it should
be referred to the editors of the <i>Era</i>, <i>Bell&rsquo;s
Life</i>, and the <i>Sporting Times</i>, and the decision of the
majority to be binding.&nbsp; If the numbers were not filled up,
the prizes were to be reduced in proportion; with some other
details.&nbsp; There was no printer&rsquo;s name to the tickets
or result-sheets.</p>
<p>The detective police-officers, in whose hands the getting-up
of evidence for the prosecution had been intrusted, proved that,
after they purchased their tickets, they went up the stairs in a
public-house about a quarter to seven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; They
went into the club-room, where about sixty or seventy persons had
assembled, and where the managers of the lotteries were selling
tickets.&nbsp; The witness purchased one, and paid a shilling for
it.&nbsp; It had the same form as the others, and the draw was to
be held that night.&nbsp; Someone got up and said (reading from
several sheets of paper in his hand), &ldquo;4,200 tickets not
sold;&rdquo; this he repeated twice.&nbsp; He then proceeded to
read from the papers the numbers of the tickets unsold.&nbsp; The
reading occupied about half-an-hour.&nbsp; After the numbers were
read out, they commenced to undo a small bundle of tickets, which
they placed upon the table.&nbsp; They fetched down some more
bundles similar to the first, and continued undoing them until
they had undone about a bushel.&nbsp; The tickets were all
numbered.&nbsp; They then proceeded to place all the <a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>tickets in
a large wheel-of-fortune, after mixing them up well with a
quantity of sand to prevent their sticking together.&nbsp; The
wheel was a kind of barrel revolving on axles, with a hole for
the hand.&nbsp; One of the managers asked if any gentleman had
got a sporting paper.&nbsp; No one answered, so he produced one
himself; he (witness) believed the <i>Sporting Life</i>.&nbsp; He
said, &ldquo;Will any gentleman read the names of the horses for
the Grand National?&rdquo;&nbsp; The names of the horses were
then read out by those at the table, while tickets were drawn for
each till all the horses were called.&nbsp; The tickets were then
put down on the table, and the defendants proceeded to undo
another packet.&nbsp; They undid a heap, about a quarter the bulk
of the first lot.&nbsp; They put these into another
wheel-of-fortune.&nbsp; Having done so, two boys about fourteen
or fifteen years old came into the room, and after divesting
themselves of their jackets and tucking up their sleeves, each
went to the wheels, which were turned by some of the persons in
the room.&nbsp; One of the managers called out the numbers of the
tickets and the name of the horse to each prize.</p>
<p>It need only be mentioned, in proof of the popularity enjoyed
by these &ldquo;specs,&rdquo; that within a fortnight afterwards
a similar scene was enacted at the same public-house.&nbsp; A
detective went to the Bedford Arms, where he heard that a
distribution of prizes was to be made.&nbsp; He went into the
club-room.&nbsp; The managers were there, with about forty
prizeholders.&nbsp; A person produced a ticket and handed it to
one of the directors, who, after examining it, said &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; and paid the money&mdash;<a
name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>405<i>l.</i>&mdash;which consisted of cheques, notes,
and gold.&nbsp; The holder of the prize got 405<i>l.</i> for a
500<i>l.</i> prize, it being supposed all the tickets were not
sold, and a reduction was made in proportion.&nbsp; About forty
prizes were given away in this manner during the evening.&nbsp;
After the prizes were drawn, each person was asked to put
something in the bowl for the two boys.</p>
<p>The prisoners were committed for trial, but were lucky enough
to escape punishment.&nbsp; For years they had been defying the
law, and feathering their nests on the strength of the silly
confidence reposed in them by the thousands of dupes who ran
after their precious &ldquo;specs;&rdquo; and the sentence of the
judge was in effect no more severe than this&mdash;it bade them
beware how they so committed themselves for the future.&nbsp; Of
course the released lottery-agents promised that they
<i>would</i> beware, and doubtless they will.&nbsp; Without being
called on to do so, they even volunteered an act of noble
generosity.&nbsp; As before stated, the police had found in their
possession and seized a large sum of money&mdash;fourteen hundred
pounds.&nbsp; This the good gentlemen of the lottery suggested
might be distributed amongst the charities of that parish their
leader honoured with his residence, and with the Recorder&rsquo;s
sanction, and amid the murmured plaudits of a crowded court, the
suggestion was adopted.&nbsp; The oddest part of the business
was, however, that the benevolent gentlemen gave away what
didn&rsquo;t belong to them, the fourteen hundred pounds
representing the many thousand shillings the believers in
&ldquo;specs&rdquo; had intrusted to their keeping.&nbsp;
However, everybody appeared <a name="page386"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 386</span>to think that the discharged
&ldquo;speculators&rdquo; had behaved honourably, not to say
nobly, and there the case ended.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;spec&rdquo; bubble exploded, the police authorities
show symptoms of bringing the machinery of the law to bear on a
wider-spread and more insidious mischief of the same breed.&nbsp;
With the betting infatuation there has naturally sprung up a
swarm of knowing hungry pike ready to take advantage of it.&nbsp;
These are the advertising tipsters, the &ldquo;turf
prophets,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;betting
commissioners.&rdquo;&nbsp; Driven from the streets, where for so
long they publicly plied their trade, they have resorted to the
cheap sporting press to make known their amiable intentions and
desires, and the terms on which they are still willing, even from
the sacred privacy of their homes, to aid and counsel all those
faint-hearted ones who despair of ruining themselves soon enough
without such friendly help.</p>
<p>Were it not for the awful amount of misery and depravity it
involves, it would be amusing to peruse the various styles of
address from the &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; to the benighted, and to
mark the many kinds of bait that are used in
&ldquo;flat-catching,&rdquo; as the turf slang has it, as well as
the peculiar method each fisherman has in the sort and size of
hook he uses, and the length of line.</p>
<p>Entitled to rank foremost in this numerous family is an
unassuming but cheerful and confident gentleman, who frequently,
and at an expensive length, advertises himself as the happy
originator and proprietor of what he styles a
&ldquo;Modus.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is described as an instrument <a
name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 387</span>of
&ldquo;beauty, force, and power,&rdquo; and it is, doubtless,
only that its owner, if he kept it all to himself, and set it
going at full blast, would undoubtedly win all the money in the
country, and so put an end to the sport, that he is induced to
offer participation in its working at the small equivalent of a
few postage-stamps.&nbsp; In his modest description of his
wonderful &ldquo;Modus,&rdquo; Mr. M. says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In daily realising incomparably rich
winnings with this Modus, another great and distinguished victory
was very successfully achieved at Newmarket Spring Meeting.&nbsp;
Mr. M.&rsquo;s distinguished Winning Modus, for beauty, force,
and power, has never yet failed in clearly realising treasures of
weekly winnings and successes.&nbsp; For this reason, this
week&rsquo;s eminent and moneyed success was the result with this
Modus at the Newmarket Spring Meeting.&nbsp; For acquiring an
ascendency over any other capital-making turf discovery, either
secret or public, it is truly marvellous.&nbsp; In fact, this
Winning Modus never deteriorates in its character, immense
riches, or winnings, for it is strikingly and truthfully
infallible and never-failing.&nbsp; At any rate, it will win
18,000<i>l.</i> or 20,000<i>l.</i> for any investor ere the final
close of the season.&nbsp; Do not think this anywise fiction, for
it is strict verity.&nbsp; Mr. M. takes this opportunity to
respectfully thank his patronisers for their compliments,
congratulations, and presents.&nbsp; It is needless to remind his
patrons that an illustrious and rich success will easily be
achieved at Chester next week, when Mr. M.&rsquo;s Winning Modus
will again realise its infallible success in
thousands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>It is
to be assumed that Mr. M. has already by means of his own
&ldquo;Modus&rdquo; fished out of the risky waters of gambling a
few of these &ldquo;18,000<i>l.</i> or 20,000<i>l.</i>&rdquo; he
speaks so lightly of; and doubtless the reader&rsquo;s first
reflection will be, that he should hasten to expend a trifle of
his immense winnings in securing for himself at least as fair a
knowledge of the English language as is possessed by a
&ldquo;dame-school&rdquo; scholar of six years old.&nbsp; It is
evident that Mr. M. has all the money at his command which he is
ever likely to require, or, of course, he would not reveal his
precious secret on such ridiculously easy terms.&nbsp; He would
patent it, and come down heavily on any rash person who infringed
his rights, more valuable than those that rest in Mr. Graves, or
even Mr. Betts, the great captain of
&ldquo;capsules.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, he has won all the money he is
ever likely to need; indeed, how can a man ever be poor while he
retains possession of that wonderful talismanic
&ldquo;Modus,&rdquo; a touch of which converts a betting-book
into a solid, substantial gold-mine?&nbsp; Still, he is exacting
as regards the gratitude of those whom his invention
enriches.&nbsp; It is his pride to record as many instances as
possible of the dutiful thankfulness of his fellow-creatures, and
as, with pity and regret, he is aware that the only earnest of a
man&rsquo;s sincerity is that which takes the shape of the
coinage of the realm, he is compelled, though sorely against his
own confiding and generous nature, to attach much weight to
thankofferings of a pecuniary nature.&nbsp; Every week he appends
to his sketch of the working of his &ldquo;Modus&rdquo; a list of
those <a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
389</span>&ldquo;patronisers&rdquo; from whom he has most
recently heard.&nbsp; It may be urged by unbelievers that in this
there is no novelty, since from time immemorial the quacks of
other professions have done precisely the same thing; but it must
be admitted that this should at least be taken as proof of Mr.
M.&rsquo;s indifference to the evil opinion of the
censorious.&nbsp; Let us take the testimonials for the week of
the Chester Races, which, as he says, &ldquo;are promiscuously
selected from a vast number:&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;For
distinction, honour, and fame, your marvellous winning Modus is
worthy of its renown.&nbsp; I am happy in asserting it has won me
4,220<i>l.</i> nett so quickly and readily this season.&nbsp;
Accept the 200<i>l.</i> enclosed.&mdash;I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">M. <span class="smcap">Arthur
Porson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. M. undoubtedly considers his winning Modus an
infallible one.&nbsp; Mr. G. Melville certainly considers it is
too.&nbsp; At any rate, Mr. Melville is the very fortunate winner
of upwards of 6,400<i>l.</i>&nbsp; 6,400<i>l.</i> at once is a
tangible criterion as to its great worth for procuring these
heavy winnings.&nbsp; Mr. Melville forwards a sum of money with
his congratulations, as a present.&nbsp; Mr. M. will please
accept the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Do me a favour in
accepting the enclosed cheque for 50<i>l.</i>&nbsp; Through the
instrumentality of your certainly very successful winning Modus,
I am, to my infinite pleasure, quickly becoming a certain and
never-failing winner of thousands; for already has its golden
agency marvellously won me 3,400<i>l.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;C. <span
class="smcap">Conyers Gresham</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 390</span>In
conclusion, this benefactor of his species says: &ldquo;For this
successful winning &lsquo;Modus,&rsquo; and its infinite riches,
forward a stamped directed envelope, addressed Mr. M.,
Rugby.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; Forward a directed
envelope to Rugby, and in return you shall be placed, booted and
spurred, on the road to infinite riches.&nbsp; If, starting as a
beggar, you allow your head to be turned by the bewildering
pelting of a pitiless storm of sovereigns, and ride to the devil,
Mr. M. is not to blame.</p>
<p>The astounding impudence of these advertising dodgers is only
equalled by the credulity of their dupes.&nbsp; How long Mr. M.
has presented his precious &ldquo;Modus&rdquo; to the sporting
public through the columns of &ldquo;horsey&rdquo; newspapers, I
cannot say; but this much is certain: that according to his
success has been the proportion of vexation and disappointment he
has caused amongst the geese who have trusted him.&nbsp; We are
assured that impostors of the M. school reap golden harvests;
that thousands on thousands weekly nibble at his baits;
consequently thousands on thousands weekly have their silly eyes
opened to the clumsy fraud to which they have been the
victims.&nbsp; But M. of Rugby flourishes still; he still vaunts
the amazing virtues, and the beauty, force, and power of his
&ldquo;Modus,&rdquo; and brags of this week&rsquo;s eminent and
moneyed success as though it were a matter of course.&nbsp; Mr.
M. of Rugby is less modest than some members of his
fraternity.&nbsp; Here is an individual who affects the
genteel:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A <span
class="smcap">Card</span>.&mdash;Private Racing
Information!!&mdash;A gentleman who has been a breeder and owner
of racehorses, <a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>and now in a good commercial position, attained by
judicious betting, enjoying rare opportunities of early
intelligence from most successful and dangerous stables, being
himself debarred by partnership restrictions from turf
speculations on his own account, thinks he might utilise the
great advantages at his disposal by leaving himself open to
correspondence with the racing public.&nbsp; This is a genuine
advertisement, and worth investigating.&mdash;Address, &mdash;,
Post-office, Stafford.&nbsp; Unquestionable references.&nbsp;
Directed envelopes.&nbsp; No &lsquo;systems&rsquo; or other
fallacies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be observed that, despite the good position attained
by the advertiser by &ldquo;judicious betting,&rdquo; not only
was he glad to escape from the field where his fortune was
founded, and to take refuge in the dull jog-trot regions of
commerce, but his &ldquo;partners&rdquo; prohibit him in future
from collecting golden eggs from any racing mare&rsquo;s-nest
whatsoever.&nbsp; He has made a fat pocket by the judicious
exercise of a peculiar and difficult science he is well versed
in; but still he is tolerated by his brother-members of the firm
only on the distinct understanding that he never does it
again.&nbsp; Perhaps he has grown over-rich, and the rest and
seclusion is necessary to the complete restoration of his
health.&nbsp; Perhaps he owes to &ldquo;Modus&rdquo;&mdash;but
no, the retired breeder and owner of racehorses distinctly
informs us that he has no faith in &ldquo;systems&rdquo; or other
fallacies: &ldquo;lying excepted,&rdquo; is the amendment that at
once occurs to the individual of common sense.</p>
<p>Education is reckoned as a prime essential to success <a
name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>in most
trades; but in that of betting it would appear unnecessary, in
order to realise a fortune for himself or his fellow-mortals,
that an advertising tipster or betting-man should be master of
the English language, let alone of the cardinal virtues.&nbsp;
Here is a member of the Manchester Subscription-rooms, in
proof:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;George D&mdash;y, member of the Manchester
Subscription-rooms, attends personally all the principal
race-meetings.&nbsp; Some persons having used the above name, G.
D. gives notice that he has not anyone betting for him, and
anyone doing so are welshers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another gentleman eschews prophecy, and would throw
&ldquo;Modus&rdquo; to the dogs, only that possibly his natural
instincts peculiarly qualify him for knowing that to do so would
be to cast an undeserved indignity on those respectable
creatures.&nbsp; He goes in for &ldquo;secret
information.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not seek to mystify his readers
by adopting a <i>nom-de-plume</i>, such as &ldquo;Stable
Mouse,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Earwig,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Spy in the
Manger.&rdquo;&nbsp; He boldly owns his identity as John &mdash;,
of Leicester-square, London, and arrogates to himself an
&ldquo;outsider&rdquo; that is to beat anything else in the
field.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not be guided,&rdquo; says this frank and
plain-spoken sportsman&mdash;&ldquo;do not be guided by the
betting, but back my outsider, whose name has scarcely ever been
mentioned in the quotations, because the very clever division to
which it belongs have put their money on so quietly that their
secret is known to only a few.&nbsp; I am in the swim, and know
that the horse did not start for one or two races it could have
won easily, but has been expressly saved <a
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>for
this.&nbsp; I have several other absolute certainties, and
guarantee to be particularly successful at Chester.&nbsp; Terms:
fourteen stamps the full meeting.&nbsp; Many of the minor events
will be reduced to certainties; and in order to take advantage of
it, I am willing to telegraph the very latest, without charge, to
those who will pay me honourably from winnings; or I will invest
any amount remitted to me, guaranteeing to telegraph before the
race is run the full particulars.&mdash;John G.,
Leicester-square, London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a pity it is that those who flatter themselves that they
are intellectually qualified to embark in one of the most
hazardous and difficult ways of making money should not be at the
pains of carefully reading and deliberating on barefaced attempts
at imposture, such as are disclosed in the above!&nbsp; John G.
is one of the &ldquo;clever division,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp; So
much for his honesty, when he admits that he is in the
&ldquo;swim&rdquo; with men who have been tampering with the same
wonderful &ldquo;outsider,&rdquo; and so man&oelig;uvering as to
throw dust in the eyes of unsuspecting persons.&nbsp; So much for
the wealth and position of the &ldquo;swim,&rdquo; when John G.,
a confessed member of it, is ready to betray his confederates for
the small consideration of fourteenpence, or less, should you
fall short of that amount of faith in his integrity.&nbsp; He
will &ldquo;leave it to you, sir,&rdquo; as does the sweeper who
clears the snow from your door, or the industrious wretch who
brushes the dust from your coat on the racecourse.&nbsp; Or he
will invest any sum you may feel disposed to intrust to
him.&nbsp; There is not the least <a name="page394"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 394</span>doubt of it; and what is more, you
may rest assured that he will invest it so as to make sure of a
substantial return.&nbsp; How else is he to cut a respectable
figure at Epsom or Ascot, and join the bold-faced, leather-lunged
gang, who, with a little money-pouch slung at their side, and a
little, a <i>very</i> little money within the pouch, elbow their
way through the press, bawling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay&rdquo; on
this, that, or t&rsquo;other?</p>
<p>J. G. of Leicester-square is not the only advertising tipster
who professes to be &ldquo;in the swim,&rdquo; and on that
account to be in a position to act as a traitor to his friends,
and the benefactor of the strange public.&nbsp; Here is the
announcement of another gentleman.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Great
Events</span>!&mdash;Enormous odds!!&mdash;Two horses have been
expressly saved; and one of the best judges on the turf tells me
they are the greatest certainties he ever knew.&nbsp; As for
another event, it is quite at the mercy of the owner of a certain
animal.&nbsp; I do not hesitate to say that there never was, and
never will be, a better chance of pulling off a large stake at a
trifling risk; for I can obtain the enormous odds of
1,840<i>l.</i> to 1<i>l.</i>, or 920<i>l.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>, or
460<i>l.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>; or I will send the secret for
fourteen stamps.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a Munchausen fit to shake hands with and claim as a
brother J. G. of Leicester-square.&nbsp; He knows of a
forthcoming race, and he likewise knows of a man who intends to
run in it a certain horse that will hold the equine contest at
his mercy.&nbsp; It is but reasonable to assume that the noble
animal in question will obey the dictates of his nature, and not
give way to weak <a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
395</span>forbearance or foolish generosity.&nbsp; Undoubtedly,
therefore, it will win the race; and the advertiser, if he puts
5<i>s.</i> on it, is <i>sure</i> of bagging 460<i>l.</i>!&nbsp;
And yet he is found competing in the same dirty field with a
score of his kindred, clamouring for fourteenpence in
postage-stamps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stable secrets! stable secrets!&rdquo; shrieks the
&ldquo;Sporting Doctor;&rdquo; secrets so very precious that he
cannot possibly betray them for less than fivepence each.&nbsp;
Send fifteen stamps, and receive in return the &ldquo;true and
certain winners of the Chester, the Derby, and the
Oaks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;Sporting Doctor&rdquo; hails from a
back-street in the Blackfriars-road.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Barber-poet&rdquo; of Paddington, in touching terms,
implores his noble patrons to assist him in advising his
fellow-creatures of the &ldquo;good things he has for
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Show my circulars to your
friends,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;it will be to my interest for you
to do so.&nbsp; I will give 100<i>l.</i> to any charitable
institution, if the advice I give is not in every instance the
best that money can obtain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next tipster on the
list goes farther than this.&nbsp; He boldly avows he will
forfeit a large sum of money unless he &ldquo;spots&rdquo; the
identical winners &ldquo;first and second.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of
course, nothing can be more transparent than bombast of this
sort; but here it is in black-and-white:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Ben W. will forfeit 500<i>l.</i> if he
does not send first and second for the Chester Cup.&nbsp; Send
four stamps and stamped envelope, and promise a present, and I
will send you the Chester Cup, Great Northern, Derby, and Oaks
winners.&mdash;Address, &mdash;, Waterloo-road,
London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 396</span>Mr.
Benjamin W.&rsquo;s suggestion of a &ldquo;promised
present&rdquo; is, however, no novelty with the advertising
tipster.&nbsp; Many of the fraternity ask a cash-down payment for
the &ldquo;tip&rdquo; they send&mdash;a sum barely sufficient to
buy them a pint of beer&mdash;professing to rely contentedly on
the generosity of their &ldquo;patronisers,&rdquo; as Mr. Modus
styles them.&nbsp; Occasionally are appended to the
advertisements gentle remonstrances and reminders that the
confidence the tipster reposed in his patroniser seems to have
been misplaced.&nbsp; The latter is requested &ldquo;not to
forget what is due from one gentleman, though in a humble sphere,
to another.&rdquo;&nbsp; One gentleman becomes quite pathetic in
an appeal of this kind:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The winners of Great Northern, Derby, and
Oaks for thirteen stamps, or one event four stamps, with promise
of present from winnings.&nbsp; Send a stamped envelope without
delay.&nbsp; Gentlemen are requested to act honourably, and send
me the promised percentage on the Two Thousand, for the labourer
is worthy of his hire.&mdash;Address, &mdash; Cumberland-street,
Chelsea, London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another gentleman, blessed with an amount of coolness and
candour that should insure him a competency if every horse were
swept off the face of the earth to-morrow, publishes the
following; and the reader will please bear in mind that these
various advertisements are clipped out of the sporting papers,
and copied to the letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Take
Notice</span>!!&mdash;I never advertise unless I am confident of
success.&nbsp; I have now a real good thing for <a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>Derby at
100 to 1; sure to get a place, for which 25 to 1 can be
obtained.&mdash;Enclose 1<i>s.</i> stamps and stamped addressed
envelope, and secure this moral.&mdash;Remember Perry
Down.&mdash;Address, H&mdash; Post-office, Reading.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be remarked, that everything that is highly promising
becomes, in the slang of the advertising tipster, a
&ldquo;moral;&rdquo; but there are two dictionary definitions of
the term&mdash;one affecting its relation to good or bad human
life, and the other which is described as &ldquo;the instruction
of a fable.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is possibly in this last sense that
the tipster uses the word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Send for my
&lsquo;moral&rsquo; on the Great Northern Handicap,&rdquo; writes
Mr. Wilson of Hull.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is said that the golden ball
flies past every man once in his lifetime!&rdquo; cries
&ldquo;Quick-sight&rdquo; of John-street, Brixton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See it in my moral certainty for the Derby.&nbsp; See it,
and fail not to grasp it.&nbsp; Fourteen stamps (uncut) will
secure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This should indeed be glad news for those unfortunates whose
vision has hitherto been gladdened in the matter of golden balls
only by seeing them hanging in triplet above the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s friendly door.&nbsp; Fancy being enabled to
grasp the golden ball&mdash;the ball that is to stump out
poverty, and send the bails of impecuniosity flying into space
never to return, at the small cost of fourteen
postage-stamps!&nbsp; They must be uncut, by the way, or their
talismanic virtue will be lost.&nbsp; The worst of it is, that
you are unable either to see it or grasp it until Quicksight sees
and grasps your fourteen stamps; and if you should happen to miss
the golden ball after all, it is doubtful if he would return you
your <a name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
398</span>poor one-and-twopence as some consolation in your
disappointment.&nbsp; He would not do this, but he would be very
happy to give you another chance.&nbsp; His stock of
&ldquo;golden balls&rdquo; is very extensive.&nbsp; He has been
supplying them, or rather the chance of grasping them, at
fourteenpence each any time during this five years, and he is
doubtless in a position to &ldquo;keep the ball rolling&rdquo;
(the golden ball) until all his customers are supplied.</p>
<p>By the way, it should be mentioned, that the advertiser last
quoted, as well as several others here instanced, terminate their
appeals by begging the public to beware of welshers!</p>
<p>Does the reader know what is a &ldquo;welsher&rdquo;&mdash;the
creature against whose malpractices the sporting public are so
emphatically warned?&nbsp; Probably he does not.&nbsp; It is
still more unlikely that he ever witnessed a
&ldquo;welsher&rdquo; hunt; and as I there have the advantage of
him, it may not be out of place here to enlighten him on both
points.&nbsp; A &ldquo;welsher&rdquo; is a person who contracts a
sporting debt without a reasonable prospect of paying it.&nbsp;
There is no legal remedy against such a defaulter.&nbsp; Although
the law to a large extent countenances the practice of betting,
and will even go the length of lending the assistance of its
police towards keeping such order that a multitude may indulge in
its gambling propensities comfortably, it will not recognise as a
just debt money owing between two wagerers.&nbsp; It is merely
&ldquo;a debt of honour,&rdquo; and the law has no machinery that
will apply thereto.&nbsp; The consequence is, that amongst the
betting fraternity, when a man shows himself dishonourable, <a
name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 399</span>he is
punished by the mob that at the time of the discovery of his
defalcation may happen to surround him; and with a degree of
severity according to the vindictiveness and brutality of the
said mob.&nbsp; On the occasion of my witnessing a &ldquo;welsher
hunt,&rdquo; I was present at the races that in the autumn of
1868 were held in Alexandra-park at Muswell-hill.&nbsp; As the
race for the Grand Prize was decided, looking down from the
gallery of the stand, I observed a sudden commotion amongst the
perspiring, bawling, leather-lunged gentry, who seek whom they
may devour, in the betting-ring below, and presently there arose
the magical cry of &ldquo;Welsher!&rdquo;&nbsp; I have heard the
sudden cry of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; raised in the night, and
watched its thrilling, rousing effect on the population; but that
was as nothing compared with it.&nbsp; Instantly, and as though
moved by one deadly hate and thirst for vengeance, a rush was
made towards a man in a black wide-awake cap, and with the
regular betting-man&rsquo;s pouch slung at his side, and who was
hurrying towards the gate of the enclosure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Welsher!
welsher!&rdquo; cried the furious mob of the ring, making at the
poor wretch; and in an instant a dozen fists were directed at his
head and face, and he was struck down; but he was a biggish man
and strong, and he was quickly on his legs, to be again struck
down and kicked and stamped on.&nbsp; He was up again, however,
without his hat, and with his face a hideous patch of crimson,
and hustled towards the gate, plunging like a madman to escape
the fury of his pursuers; but the policeman blocked the way, and
they caught him again, and some <a name="page400"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 400</span>punched at his face, while others
tore off his clothes.&nbsp; One ruffian&mdash;I cannot otherwise
describe him&mdash;plucked at the poor devil&rsquo;s shirt at the
breast, and tore away a tattered handful of it, which he flung
over to the great yelling crowd now assembled without the rails;
another tore away his coat-sleeves, and tossed them aloft; and in
the same way he lost his waistcoat and one of his boots.&nbsp; It
seemed as though, if they detained him another moment, the man
must be murdered, and so the policeman made way for him to
escape.</p>
<p>From the frying-pan into the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Welsher!
welsher!&rdquo;&nbsp; The air rang with the hateful word, and,
rushing from the gate, he was at once snatched at by the foremost
men of the mouthing, yelling mob outside, who flung him down and
punched and beat him.&nbsp; Fighting for his life, he struggled
and broke away, and ran; but a betting-man flung his tall stool
at him, and brought him to earth again for the twentieth time,
and again the punching and kicking process was resumed.&nbsp; How
he escaped from these was a miracle, but escape he did; and with
the desperation of a rat pursued by dogs, dived into an empty
hansom cab, and there lay crouched while fifty coward hands were
stretched forward to drag him out, or, failing in that, to prog
and poke at him with walking-sticks and umbrellas.&nbsp; At last,
a mounted policeman spurred his horse forward and came to the
rescue, keeping his steed before the place of refuge.&nbsp; Then
the furious mob, that was not to be denied, turned on the
policeman, and only his great courage and determination <a
name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 401</span>saved him
from being unhorsed and ill-treated.&nbsp; Then other police came
up, and the poor tattered wretch, ghastly, white, and streaming
with blood, was hauled out and dragged away insensible, with his
head hanging and his legs trailing in the dust, amid the howling
and horrible execrations of five thousand Englishmen.</p>
<p>The next consideration was what to do with him.&nbsp; To
convey him off the premises was impossible, since a space of
nearly a quarter of a mile had to be traversed ere the outer gate
could be reached.&nbsp; There was no &ldquo;lock-up&rdquo; at the
new grand stand, as at Epsom and elsewhere.&nbsp; Nothing
remained but to hustle him through a trap-door, and convey him by
an underground route to a cellar, in which empty bottles were
deposited.&nbsp; And grateful indeed must have been the stillness
and the coolness of such a sanctuary after the fierce ordeal he
had so recently undergone.&nbsp; Whether water was supplied him
to wash his wounds, or if a doctor was sent for, is more than I
can say.&nbsp; There he was allowed to remain till night, when he
slunk home; and within a few days afterwards a local newspaper
briefly announced that the &ldquo;unfortunate man, who had so
rashly roused the fury of the sporting fraternity at Alexandra
races, was dead&rdquo;!</p>
<p>To a close observer of the system that rules at all great
horseracing meetings, nothing is so remarkable as the child-like
reliance with which the general public intrusts its bettings to
the keeping of the &ldquo;professionals,&rdquo; who there swarm
in attendance.&nbsp; In the case of the bettors of the
&ldquo;ring&rdquo; they may be tolerably safe, <a
name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 402</span>since it is
to the interest of all that the atmosphere of that sacred
enclosure, only to be gained at the cost of half-a-guinea or so,
should be kept passably sweet.&nbsp; Besides, as was mentioned in
the case of the unfortunate &ldquo;welsher&rdquo; at Alexandra
races, the said enclosure is bounded by high railings; and the
salutary effect of catching and killing a &ldquo;welsher&rdquo;
is universally acknowledged.&nbsp; As regards the betting men
themselves, it enables them to give vent to reckless ferocity
that naturally waits on disappointed greed, while the public at
large are impressed with the fact that strict principles of
honour amongst gamblers really do prevail, whatever may have been
said to the contrary.&nbsp; But at all the principal races the
greatest number of bets, if not the largest amounts of money, are
risked outside the magic circle.&nbsp; It is here that the
huckster and small pedlar of the betting fraternity conjure with
the holiday-making shoemaker or carpenter for his
half-crown.&nbsp; For the thousandth time one cannot help
expressing amazement that men who have to work so hard for their
money&mdash;shrewd, hard-headed, sensible fellows as a
rule&mdash;should part with it on so ludicrously flimsy a
pretext.&nbsp; Here&mdash;all amongst the refreshment bustle,
from which constantly streamed men hot from the beer and spirit
counters&mdash;swarmed hundreds of these betting harpies; some in
carts, but the majority of them perched on a stool, each with a
bit of paper, on which some name was printed, stuck on his hat,
and with a money-bag slung at his side, and a pencil and a
handful of tickets.&nbsp; This was all.&nbsp; As often as not the
name and address on the <a name="page403"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 403</span>betting man&rsquo;s hat or money-bag
was vaguely expressed as &ldquo;S. Pipes, Nottingham,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;John Brown, Oxford-street;&rdquo; and who Pipes or Brown
was not one man in a thousand had the least idea.&nbsp; Nor did
they inquire, the silly gulls.&nbsp; It was enough for them they
saw a man on a stool, ostensibly a &ldquo;betting man,&rdquo;
bawling out at the top of his great, vulgar, slangy voice what
odds he was prepared to lay on this, that, or t&rsquo;other; and
they flocked round&mdash;enticed by terms too good to be by any
possibility true, if they only were cool enough to consider for a
moment&mdash;and eagerly tendered to the rogue on the stool their
crowns and half-crowns, receiving from the strange Mr. Pipes or
Mr. Brown nothing in exchange but a paltry little ticket with a
number on it.&nbsp; This, for the present, concluded the
transaction; and off went the acceptor of the betting man&rsquo;s
odds to see the race on which the stake depended.&nbsp; In very
many cases the exchange of the little ticket for the money
concluded the transaction, not only for the present, but for all
future; for, having plucked all the gulls that could be caught,
nothing is easier than for Pipes to exchange hats with Brown and
to shift their places; and the pretty pair may with impunity
renounce all responsibility, and open a book on the next race on
the programme.&nbsp; To be sure it is hard to find patience with
silly people who <i>will</i> walk into a well; and when they
follow the workings of their own free will, it is scarcely too
much to say they are not to be pitied.&nbsp; But when a cheat or
sharper is permitted standing room that he may pursue his common
avocation, <a name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
404</span>which is to cheat and plunder the unwary public, the
matter assumes a slightly different complexion.</p>
<p>Of all manner of advertising betting gamblers, however, none
are so pernicious, or work such lamentable evil against society,
as those who, with devilish cunning, appeal to the young and
inexperienced&mdash;the factory lad and the youth of the
counting-house or the shop.&nbsp; Does anyone doubt if
horseracing has attractions for those whose tender age renders it
complimentary to style them &ldquo;young men&rdquo;?&nbsp; Let
him on the day of any great race convince himself.&nbsp; Let him
make a journey on the afternoon of &ldquo;Derby-day,&rdquo; for
instance, to Fleet-street or the Strand, where the offices of the
sporting newspapers are situated.&nbsp; It may not be generally
known that the proprietors of the <i>Sunday Times</i>,
<i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>, and other journals of a sporting
tendency, in their zeal to outdo each other in presenting the
earliest possible information to the public, are at the trouble
and expense of securing the earliest possible telegram of the
result of a horserace, and exhibiting it enlarged on a
broad-sheet in their shop-windows.&nbsp; Let us take the
<i>Sunday Times</i>, for instance.&nbsp; The office of this most
respectable of sporting newspapers is situated near the corner of
Fleet-street, at Ludgate-hill; and wonderful is the spectacle
there to be seen on the afternoon of the great equine contest on
Epsom downs.&nbsp; On a small scale, and making allowance for the
absence of the living provocatives of excitement, the scene is a
reproduction of what at that moment, or shortly since, has taken
place on the racecourse itself.&nbsp; Three o&rsquo;clock is <a
name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 405</span>about the
time the great race is run at Epsom, and at that time the
Fleet-street crowd begins to gather.&nbsp; It streams in from the
north, from the east, from the south.&nbsp; At a glance it is
evident that the members of it are not idly curious merely.&nbsp;
It is not composed of ordinary pedestrians who happen to be
coming that way.&nbsp; Butcher-lads, from the neighbouring great
meat-market, come bareheaded and perspiring down Ludgate-hill,
and at a pace that tells how exclusively their eager minds are
set on racing: all in blue working-smocks, and with the grease
and blood of their trade adhering to their naked arms, and to
their hob-nailed boots, and to their hair.&nbsp; Hot and
palpitating they reach the obelisk in the middle of the road, and
there they take their stand, with their eyes steadfastly fixed on
that at present blank and innocent window that shall presently
tell them of their fate.</p>
<p>I mention the butcher-boys first, because, for some unknown
reason, they undoubtedly are foremost in the rank of juvenile
bettors.&nbsp; In the days when the Fleet-lane betting
abomination as yet held out against the police authorities, and
day after day a narrow alley behind the squalid houses there
served as standing room for as many &ldquo;professional&rdquo;
betting men, with their boards and money-pouches, as could crowd
in a row, an observer standing at one end of the lane might count
three blue frocks for one garment of any other colour.&nbsp; But
though butcher-boys show conspicuously among the anxious
Fleet-street rush on a Derby-day, they are not in a majority by a
long way.&nbsp; To bet on the &ldquo;Derby&rdquo; is <a
name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 406</span>a mania
that afflicts all trades; and streaming up Farringdon-street may
he seen representatives of almost every craft that practises
within the City&rsquo;s limits.&nbsp; There is the inky
printer&rsquo;s-boy, hot from the &ldquo;machine-room,&rdquo;
with his grimy face and his cap made of a ream wrapper; there is
the jeweller&rsquo;s apprentice, with his bibbed white apron,
ruddy with the powder of rouge and borax; and the
paper-stainer&rsquo;s lad, with the variegated splashes of the
pattern of his last &ldquo;length&rdquo; yet wet on his ragged
breeches; and a hundred others, all hurrying pell-mell to the one
spot, and, in nine cases out of ten, with the guilt of having
&ldquo;slipped out&rdquo; visible on their streaming faces.&nbsp;
Take their ages as they congregate in a crowd of five hundred and
more (they are expected in such numbers that special policemen
are provided to keep the roadway clear), and it will be found
that more than half are under the age of eighteen.&nbsp;
Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that in the majority of
cases a single lad represents a score or more employed in one
&ldquo;office&rdquo; or factory.&nbsp; They cast lots who shall
venture on the unlawful mission, and it has fallen on him.&nbsp;
Again, and as before mentioned, the <i>Sunday Times</i> is but
one of ten or a dozen sporting newspapers published between
Ludgate-hill and St. Clement Danes; and in the vicinity of every
office may be met a similar crowd.&nbsp; Let the reader bear
these facts in mind, and he may arrive at some faint idea of the
prevalence of the horse-gambling evil amongst the rising
generation.</p>
<p>The significance of these various facts is plain to the <a
name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 407</span>advertising
tipster, and he shapes his baits accordingly.&nbsp; He never
fails to mention, in apprising his youthful admirers, that, in
exchange for the last &ldquo;good thing,&rdquo; postage-stamps
will be taken.&nbsp; Well enough the cunning unscrupulous villain
knows that in the commercial world postage-stamps are articles of
very common use, and that at many establishments they are dealt
out carelessly, and allowed to lie about in drawers and desks for
the &ldquo;common use.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is temptation ready to
hand!&nbsp; &ldquo;Send fourteen stamps to Dodger, and receive in
return the <i>certain</i> tip as to who will win the
Derby.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are the stamps, and the ink, and the
pen, and the envelope, and nothing remains but to apply them to
the use Dodger suggests.&nbsp; It is not stealing, at least it
does not seem like stealing, this tearing fourteen stamps from a
sheet at which everybody in the office has access, and which will
be replaced without question as soon as it is exhausted.&nbsp; It
is at most only &ldquo;cribbing.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is the
difference between writing a private note on the office paper and
appropriating a few paltry stamps?&nbsp; It would be different if
the fourteenpence was in hard money&mdash;a shilling and two
penny-pieces.&nbsp; No young bookkeeper with any pretensions to
honesty would be guilty of stealing <i>money</i> from his
master&rsquo;s office&mdash;but a few stamps!&nbsp; Dodger knows
this well enough, and every morning quite a bulky parcel of
crummy-feeling letters are delivered at his residence in some
back street in the Waterloo-road.</p>
<p>This is the way that Dodger angles for &ldquo;flat-fish&rdquo;
of tender age:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page408"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
408</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Great Results from small
Efforts</span>!&mdash;In order to meet the requirements of those
of humble means, W. W&mdash;n, of Tavistock-street, is prepared
to receive small sums for investment on the forthcoming great
events.&nbsp; Sums as low as two-and-sixpence in stamps (uncut)
may be sent to the above address, and they will be invested with
due regard to our patron&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp; Recollect that
at the present time there are Real Good things in the market at
100 to 1, and that even so small a sum put on such will return
the speculator twelve pounds ten shillings, less ten per cent
commission, which is Mr. W.&rsquo;s charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faint heart never won a fortune!&nbsp; It is on record
that the most renowned Leviathan of the betting world began his
career as third-hand in a butcher&rsquo;s shop!&nbsp; He had a
&lsquo;fancy&rsquo; for a horse, and was so strongly impressed
with the idea that it would win, that he begged and borrowed
every farthing he could raise, and even pawned the coat off his
back!&nbsp; His pluck and resolution was nobly rewarded.&nbsp;
The horse he backed was at 70 to 1, and he found himself after
the race the owner of nearly a thousand pounds!&nbsp; Bear this
in mind.&nbsp; There are as good fish in the sea as ever came out
of it.&nbsp; Lose no time in forwarding fourteen stamps to Alpha,
John-street, Nottingham; and wait the happy result.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is this but a plain and unmistakable intimation, on the
part of the advertising blackguard, that his dupes should
<i>stick at nothing</i> to raise money to bet on the
&ldquo;forthcoming great event&rdquo;?&nbsp; Pawn, beg,
borrow&mdash;<a name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
409</span><i>anything</i>, only don&rsquo;t let the chance
slip.&nbsp; Butcher-boys, think of the luck of your Leviathan
craftsman, and at once take the coat off your back, or if you
have not a garment good enough, your master&rsquo;s coat out of
the clothes-closet, and hasten to pawn it.&nbsp; Never fear for
the happy result.&nbsp; Long before he can miss it, you will be
able to redeem it, besides being in a position to snap your
fingers at him, and, if you please, to start on your own
&ldquo;hook&rdquo; as a bookmaker.</p>
<p>Another of these &ldquo;youths&rsquo; guide to the turf&rdquo;
delicately points out that, if bettors will only place themselves
in his hands, he will &ldquo;pull them through, and land them
high and dry,&rdquo; certainly and surely, and with a handsome
return for their investments.&nbsp; &ldquo;No knowledge of racing
matters is requisite on the part of the investor,&rdquo; writes
this quack; &ldquo;indeed, as in all other business affairs of
life, &lsquo;a little knowledge is a dangerous
thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; Better trust <i>entirely</i> to one who has
made it the one study of his existence, and can read off the
pedigree and doings of every horse that for the past ten years
has run for money.&nbsp; Large investments are not
recommended.&nbsp; Indeed, the beginner should in no case
&lsquo;put on&rsquo; more than a half-sovereign, and as low as
half-a-crown will often be sufficient, and in the hands of a
practised person like the advertiser be made to go as far as an
injudiciously invested pound or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know in how many instances these
vermin of the betting-field are successful, how many of them
there are who live by bleeding the <a name="page410"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 410</span>simple and the infatuated, and what
sort of living it is.&nbsp; Not a very luxurious one, it would
seem, judging from the shady quarters of the town from which the
&ldquo;tipster&rdquo; usually hails; but then we have to bear in
mind the venerable maxim, &ldquo;Light come, light go,&rdquo; and
its probable application to those harpies who hanker after
&ldquo;uncut&rdquo; stamps and receive them in thousands.&nbsp;
That very many of them find it a game worth pursuing, there can
be no doubt, or they would not so constantly resort to the
advertising columns of the newspapers.&nbsp; How much mischief
they really do, one can never learn.&nbsp; The newspaper
announcement is, of course, but a preliminary to further
business: you send your stamps, and what you in most cases get in
return is not the information for which you imagined you were
bargaining, but a &ldquo;card of terms&rdquo; of the
tipster&rsquo;s method of doing business.&nbsp; There is nothing
new or novel in this.&nbsp; It is an adaptation of the ancient
dodge of the medical quack who advertises a &ldquo;certain
cure&rdquo; for &ldquo;all the ills that flesh is heir to,&rdquo;
on receipt of seven postage-stamps; but all that you receive for
your sevenpence is a printed recipe for the concoction of certain
stuffs, &ldquo;to be had only&rdquo; of the advertiser.</p>
<p>And well would it be for the gullible public if the mischief
done by the advertising fraternity of horse-racing quacks was
confined to the &ldquo;fourteen uncut stamps&rdquo; they have
such an insatiable hunger for.&nbsp; There can be no doubt,
however, that this is but a mild and inoffensive branch of their
nefarious profession.&nbsp; In almost every case they combine
with the exercise <a name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
411</span>of their supernatural gift of prophecy the
matter-of-fact business of the &ldquo;commission agent,&rdquo;
and, if rumour whispers true, they make of it at times a business
as infernal in its working as can well be imagined.&nbsp; They
can, when occasion serves, be as &ldquo;accommodating&rdquo; as
the loan-office swindler or the 60-per-cent bill-discounter, and
a profit superior to that yielded by either of these avocations
may be realised, and that with scarce any trouble at all.&nbsp;
No capital is required, excepting a considerable stock of
impudence and a fathomless fund of cold-blooded rascality.</p>
<p>Judging from the fact that the species of villany in question
has never yet been exposed in a police-court, it is only fair to
imagine that it is a modern invention; on that account I am the
more anxious to record and make public an item of evidence
bearing on the subject that, within the past year, came under my
own observation.</p>
<p>It can be scarcely within the year, though, for it was at the
time when an audacious betting gang &ldquo;squatted&rdquo; in the
vicinity of Ludgate-hill, and, owing to some hitch in the
law&rsquo;s machinery, they could not easily be removed.&nbsp;
First they swarmed in Bride-lane, Fleet-street.&nbsp; Being
compelled to &ldquo;move on,&rdquo; they migrated to a most
appropriate site, the waste land on which for centuries stood the
infamous houses of Field-lane and West-street, and beneath which
flowed the filthy Fleet-ditch.&nbsp; But even this was accounted
ground too good to be desecrated by the foot of the gambling
blackleg, and they were one fine morning bundled off it by a
strong body of City <a name="page412"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 412</span>police.&nbsp; After this they made a
desperate stand on the prison side of the way in
Farringdon-street, and for some months there remained.</p>
<p>It was at this time that I made the acquaintance of the
subject of the present little story.&nbsp; I had noticed him
repeatedly, with his pale haggard face and his dull eyes, out of
which nothing but weariness of life looked.&nbsp; He was a tall
slim young fellow, and wore his patched and seedy clothes as
though he had been used to better attire; and, despite the
tell-tale shabbiness of his boots and his wretched tall black
hat, he still clung to the respectable habit of wearing black
kid-gloves, though it was necessary to shut his fists to hide the
dilapidations at their finger-tips.</p>
<p>He was not remarkable amongst the betting blackguards he
mingled with on account of the active share he took in the
questionable business in which they were engaged; on the
contrary, he seemed quite out of place with them, and though
occasionally one would patronise him with a nod, it was evident
that he was &ldquo;nothing to them,&rdquo; either as a comrade or
a gull to be plucked.&nbsp; He appeared to be drawn towards them
by a fascination he could not resist, but which he deplored and
was ashamed of.&nbsp; It was customary in those times for the
prosperous horse-betting gambler to affect the genteel person who
could afford to keep a &ldquo;man,&rdquo; and to press into his
service some poor ragged wretch glad to earn a sixpence by
wearing his master&rsquo;s &ldquo;card of terms&rdquo; round his
neck for the inspection of any person inclined to do
business.&nbsp; The tall shabby young fellow&rsquo;s <a
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>chief
occupation consisted in wandering restlessly from one of these
betting-card bearers to another, evidently with a view to
comparing &ldquo;prices&rdquo; and &ldquo;odds&rdquo; offered on
this or that horse; but he never bet.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
that his pecuniary affairs would have permitted him, even though
a bet as low as twopence-halfpenny might be laid.</p>
<p>I was always on the look-out for my miserable-looking young
friend whenever I passed that way, and seldom failed to find
him.&nbsp; He seemed to possess for me a fascination something
like that which horse-betting possessed for him.&nbsp; One
afternoon, observing him alone and looking even more miserable
than I had yet seen him, as he slouched along the miry pavement
towards Holborn, I found means to start a conversation with
him.&nbsp; My object was to learn who and what he was, and
whether he was really as miserable as he looked, and whether
there was any help for him.&nbsp; I was prepared to exercise all
the ingenuity at my command to compass this delicate project, but
he saved me the trouble.&nbsp; As though he was glad of the
chance of doing so, before we were half-way up Holborn-hill he
turned the conversation exactly into the desired groove, and by
the time the Tottenham-court-road was reached (he turned down
there), I knew even more of his sad history than is here
subjoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the business pursuit that takes me amongst the
betting-men?&nbsp; O no, sir, I&rsquo;m not at all astonished
that you should ask the question; I&rsquo;ve asked it of myself
so often, that it doesn&rsquo;t come new to me.&nbsp; I pursue <a
name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 414</span>no
business, sir.&nbsp; What business <i>could</i> a wretched
scarecrow like I am pursue?&nbsp; Say that <i>I</i> am pursued,
and you will be nearer the mark.&nbsp; Pursued by what I can
never get away from or shake off: damn it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He uttered the concluding wicked word with such decisive and
bitter emphasis, that I began to think that he had done with the
subject; but he began again almost immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to the Lord I had a business pursuit!&nbsp; If
ever a fellow was tired of his life, I am.&nbsp; Well&mdash;yes,
I <i>am</i> a young man; but it&rsquo;s precious small
consolation that that fact brings me.&nbsp; Hang it, no!&nbsp;
All the longer to endure it.&nbsp; How long have I endured
it?&nbsp; Ah, now you come to the point.&nbsp; For years, you
think, I daresay.&nbsp; You look at me, and you think to
yourself, &lsquo;There goes a poor wretch who has been on the
downhill road so long that it&rsquo;s time that he came to the
end of it, or made an end to it.&rsquo;&nbsp; There you are
mistaken.&nbsp; Eighteen months ago I was well dressed and
prosperous.&nbsp; I was second clerk to &mdash;, the provision
merchants, in St. Mary Axe, on a salary of a hundred and forty
pounds&mdash;rising twenty each year.&nbsp; Now look at me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not ask me how it came about.&nbsp; You say
that you have seen me often in Farringdon-street with the
betting-men, so you can give a good guess as to how I came to
ruin, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&nbsp; Yes, sir, it was horse-betting
that did my business.&nbsp; No, I did not walk to ruin with my
eyes open, and because I liked the road.&nbsp; I was trapped into
it, sir, as I&rsquo;ll be bound <a name="page415"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 415</span>scores and scores of young fellows
have been.&nbsp; I never had a passion for betting.&nbsp; I
declare that, till within the last two years, I never made a bet
in my life.&nbsp; The beginning of it was, that, for the fun of
the thing, I wagered ten shillings with a fellow-clerk about the
Derby that was just about to come off.&nbsp; I never took any
interest in horseracing before; but when I had made that bet I
was curious to look over the sporting news, and to note the odds
against the favourite.&nbsp; One unlucky day I was fool enough to
answer the advertisement of a professional tipster.&nbsp; He
keeps the game going still, curse him!&nbsp; You may read his
name in the papers this morning.&nbsp; If I wasn&rsquo;t such an
infernal coward, you know, I should kill that man.&nbsp; If I
hadn&rsquo;t the money to buy a pistol, I ought to steal one, and
shoot the thief.&nbsp; But, what do you think?&nbsp; I met him on
Monday, and he chaffed me about my boots.&nbsp; It was raining at
the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I had a pair of waterproofs like
yours, Bobby.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never take cold while they let
all the water out at the heel they take in at the
toe!&rsquo;&nbsp; Fancy me standing <i>that</i> after the way he
had served me!&nbsp; Fancy this too&mdash;me borrowing a shilling
of him, and saying &lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; for it!&nbsp;
Why, you know, I ought to be pumped on for doing it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wrote to &lsquo;Robert B&mdash;y, Esq., of
Leicester,&rsquo; and sent the half-crown&rsquo;s worth of stamps
asked for.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I got in
return.&nbsp; Anyhow, it was something that set my mind on
betting, and I wrote again and again.&nbsp; At first his replies
were of a distant and business sort; but in a month or so after I
had <a name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
416</span>written to him to complain of being misguided by him,
he wrote back a friendly note to say that he wasn&rsquo;t at all
surprised to hear of my little failures&mdash;novices always did
fail.&nbsp; They absurdly attempt what they did not
understand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just to show you the difference,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;just give me a commission to invest a pound for
you on the Ascot Cup.&nbsp; All that I charge is seven and a half
per cent on winnings.&nbsp; Try it just for once; a pound
won&rsquo;t break you, and it may open your eyes to the way that
fortunes are made.&rsquo;&nbsp; I ought to have known then, that
either he, or somebody in London he had set on, had been making
inquiries about me, for the other notes were sent to where mine
were directed from&mdash;my private lodgings&mdash;but this one
came to me at the warehouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I sent the pound, and within a week received a
post-office order for four pounds eight as the result of its
investment.&nbsp; The same week I bet again&mdash;two pounds this
time&mdash;and won one pound fifteen.&nbsp; That was over six
pounds between Monday and Saturday.&nbsp; &lsquo;This <i>is</i>
the way that fortunes are made,&rsquo; I laughed to myself, like
a fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he kept me going, I don&rsquo;t exactly recollect
how, between Ascot and Goodwood, which is about seven weeks, not
more.&nbsp; Sometimes I won, sometimes I lost, but, on the whole,
I was in pocket.&nbsp; I was such a fool at last, that I was
always for betting more than he advised.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got his
letters at home now, in which he says, &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be
rash; take my advice, and bear in mind that great risks mean
great losses, as well as great <a name="page417"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 417</span>gains, at times.&rsquo;&nbsp; Quite
fatherly, you know!&nbsp; The infernal scoundrel!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one day there came a telegram to the office for
me.&nbsp; I was just in from my dinner.&nbsp; It was from
B&mdash;y.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now you may bag a hundred pounds at a
shot,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;The odds are short, but the
result <i>certain</i>.&nbsp; Never mind the money just now.&nbsp;
You are a gentleman, and I will trust you.&nbsp; You know that my
motto has all along been &lsquo;Caution.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now it is
&lsquo;Go in and win.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is <i>sure</i>.&nbsp; Send
me a word immediately, or it may be too late; and, if you are
wise, put a &lsquo;lump&rsquo; on it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the infernal document&mdash;the death-warrant
of all my good prospects.&nbsp; It was the rascal&rsquo;s candour
that deceived me.&nbsp; He had all along said, &lsquo;Be
cautious, don&rsquo;t be impatient to launch out;&rsquo; and now
this patient careful villain saw his chance, and advised,
&lsquo;Go in and win.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was quite in a maze at the
prospect of bagging a hundred pounds.&nbsp; To win that sum the
odds were so short on the horse he mentioned, that fifty pounds
had to be risked.&nbsp; But he said that there was <i>no</i>
risk, and I believed him.&nbsp; I sent him back a telegram at
once to execute the commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse lost.&nbsp; I knew it next morning before I
was up, for I had sent for the newspaper; and while I was in the
midst of my fright, up comes my landlady to say that a gentleman
of the name of B&mdash;y wished to see me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had never seen him before, and he seemed an easy
fellow enough.&nbsp; He was in a terrible way&mdash;chiefly on my
account&mdash;though the Lord only knew how much <i>he</i> <a
name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 418</span>had lost
over the &lsquo;sell.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had come up by express
purely to relieve my anxiety, knowing how &lsquo;funky&rsquo;
young gentlemen sometimes were over such trifles.&nbsp; Although
he had really paid the fifty in hard gold out of his pocket, he
was in no hurry for it.&nbsp; He would take my bill at two
months.&nbsp; It would be all right, no doubt.&nbsp; He had
conceived a liking for me, merely from my straightforward way of
writing.&nbsp; Now that he had had the pleasure of seeing me, he
shouldn&rsquo;t trouble himself a fig if the fifty that I owed
him was five hundred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare to you that I knew so little about bills,
that I didn&rsquo;t know how to draw one out; but I was mighty
glad to be shown the way and to give it him, and thank him over
and over again for his kindness.&nbsp; That was the beginning of
my going to the devil.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t been a fool, I
might have saved myself even then, for I had friends who would
have lent or given me twice fifty pounds if I had asked them for
it.&nbsp; But I <i>was</i> a fool.&nbsp; In the course of a day
or two I got a note from B&mdash;y, reminding me that the way out
of the difficulty was by the same path as I had got into one, and
that a little judicious &lsquo;backing&rsquo; would set me right
before even my bill fell due.&nbsp; And I was fool enough to walk
into the snare.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t borrow to pay the fifty
pounds, but I borrowed left and right, of my mother, of my
brothers, on all manner of lying pretences, to follow the
&lsquo;advice&rsquo; B&mdash;y was constantly sending me.&nbsp;
When I came to the end of their forbearance, I did more than
borrow; but that we won&rsquo;t speak of.&nbsp; In <a
name="page419"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 419</span>five months
from the beginning, I was without a relative who would own me or
speak to me, and without an employer&mdash;cracked up,
ruined.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s B&mdash;y, as I said before, with
his white hat cocked on one side of his head, and his gold
toothpick, chaffing me about my old boots.&nbsp; What do I do for
a living?&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve told you such a precious lot, I
may as well tell you that too.&nbsp; Where I lodge it&rsquo;s a
&lsquo;leaving-shop,&rsquo; and the old woman that keeps it
can&rsquo;t read or write, and I keep her &lsquo;book&rsquo; for
her.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s how I get a bit of breakfast and supper
and a bed to lie on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Since the above was written, the police, under the energetic
guidance of their new chief, have been making vigorous and
successful warfare against public gamblers and gambling
agents.&nbsp; The &ldquo;spec&rdquo; dodge has been annihilated,
&ldquo;betting-shops&rdquo; have been entered and routed, and
there is even fair promise that the worst feature of the bad
business, that which takes refuge behind the specious cloak of
the &ldquo;commission-agent,&rdquo; may be put down.&nbsp; That
it may be so, should be the earnest wish of all right-thinking
men, who would break down this barrier of modern and monstrous
growth, that blocks the advancement of social purity, and causes
perhaps more ruin and irreparable dismay than any other two of
the Curses herein treated of.]</p>

<p>This as regards parochial charity.&nbsp; It must not be
imagined, however, from this source alone flows all the relief
that the nation&rsquo;s humanity and benevolence provides for the
relief of its poor and helpless.&nbsp; Besides our parochial
asylums there are many important charities of magnitude,
providing a sum of at least 2,000,000<i>l.</i> a-year for the
relief of want and suffering in London, independently of legal
and local provision to an amount hardly calculable.&nbsp; We
content ourselves with stating one simple fact&mdash;that all
this charity, as now bestowed and applied, fails to accomplish
the direct object in view.&nbsp; If the 2,000,000<i>l.</i> thus
contributed did in some way or other suffice, in conjunction with
other funds, to banish want and suffering from the precincts of
the metropolis, we should have very little to say.&nbsp; But the
fact is that, after all these incredible efforts to relieve
distress, want and suffering are so prevalent that it might be
fancied charity was dead amongst us.&nbsp; Now that, at any rate,
cannot be a result in which anybody would willingly
acquiesce.&nbsp; If the money was spent, and the poor were
relieved, <a name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
424</span>many people probably would never trouble themselves to
inquire any further; but though the money is spent, the poor are
not cured of their poverty.&nbsp; In reality this very fact is
accountable in itself for much of that accumulation of agencies,
institutions, and efforts which our statistics expose.&nbsp; As
has been recently remarked: &ldquo;A certain expenditure by the
hands of a certain society fails to produce the effect
anticipated, and so the result is a new society, with a new
expenditure, warranted to be more successful.&nbsp; It would be a
curious item in the account if the number and succession of fresh
charities, year after year, could be stated.&nbsp; They would
probably be found, like religious foundations, taking some new
forms according to the discoveries or presumptions of the age;
but all this while the old charities are still going on, and the
new charity becomes old in its turn, to be followed, though not
superseded, by a fresh creation in due time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it be asked what, under such circumstances, the public can
be expected to do, we answer, that it may really do much by easy
inquiry and natural conclusions.&nbsp; Whenever an institution is
supported by voluntary contributions, the contributors, if they
did but know it, have the entire control of the establishment in
their hands; they can stop the supplies, they hold the purse, and
they can stipulate for any kind of information, disclosure, or
reform at their pleasure.&nbsp; They can exact the publication of
accounts at stated intervals, and the production of the
balance-sheet according to any given form.&nbsp; It is at their
discretion to insist <a name="page425"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 425</span>upon amalgamation, reorganisation,
or any other promising measure.&nbsp; There is good reason for
the exercise of these powers.&nbsp; We have said that all this
charity fails to accomplish its one immediate object&mdash;the
relief of the needy; but that is a very imperfect statement of
the case.&nbsp; The fact is that pauperism, want, and suffering
are rapidly growing upon us in this metropolis, and we are making
little or no headway against the torrent.&nbsp; The
administration of the Poor-law is as unsuccessful as that of
private benevolence.&nbsp; Legal rates, like voluntary
subscriptions, increase in amount, till the burden can hardly be
endured; and still the cry for aid continues.&nbsp; Is nothing to
be done, then, save to go on in the very course which has proved
fruitless?&nbsp; Must we still continue giving, when giving to
all appearances does so little good?&nbsp; It would be better to
survey the extent and nature of agencies actually at work, and to
see whether they cannot be made to yield greater results.</p>
<p>Confining ourselves, however, to what chiefly concerns the
hardly-pressed ratepayers of the metropolis, its vagrancy and
pauperism, there at once arises the question, How can this
enormous army of helpless ones be provided for in the most
satisfactory manner?&mdash;This problem has puzzled the social
economist since that bygone happy age when poor-rates were
unknown, and the &ldquo;collector&rdquo; appeared in a form no
more formidable than that of the parish priest, who, from his
pulpit, exhorted his congregation to give according to their
means, and not to forget the poor-box as they passed out.</p>
<p><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 426</span>It is
not a &ldquo;poor-box&rdquo; of ordinary dimensions that would
contain the prodigious sums necessary to the maintenance of the
hundred thousand ill-clad and hungry ones that, in modern times,
plague the metropolis.&nbsp; Gradually the sum-total required has
crept up, till, at the present time, it has attained dimensions
that press on the neck of the striving people like the Old Man of
the Sea who so tormented Sinbad, and threatened to strangle
him.</p>
<p>In London alone the cost of relief has doubled since
1851.&nbsp; In that year the total relief amounted to
659,000<i>l.</i>; in 1858 it had increased to 870,000<i>l.</i>;
in 1867 to 1,180,000<i>l.</i>; and in 1868 to
1,317,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; The population within this time has
increased from 2,360,000 to something like 3,100,000, the
estimated population at the present time; so that while the
population has increased by only 34 per cent, the cost of relief
has exactly doubled.&nbsp; Thirteen per cent of the whole
population of London were relieved as paupers in 1851, and in
1868 the percentage had increased to 16.&nbsp; In 1861 the Strand
Union had a decreasing population of 8,305, and in 1868 it
relieved one in every five, or 20 per cent, of that
population.&nbsp; Besides this, the cost of relief per head
within the workhouse had much increased within the last 15
years.&nbsp; The cost of food consumed had increased from
2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per head, per week, in 1853, to 4<i>s.</i>
11<i>d.</i> in 1868; while we have the authority of Mr. Leone
Levi for the statement that a farm-labourer expended only
3<i>s.</i> a-week on food for himself.</p>
<p>In 1853 the population of England and Wales was <a
name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>in round
numbers 18,404,000, and in 1867 21,429,000, being an increase of
3,000,000.&nbsp; The number of paupers, exclusive of vagrants, in
receipt of relief in England and Wales was, in 1854, 818,000, and
in 1868 1,034,000, showing an increase of 216,000.&nbsp; The
total amount expended in relief to the poor and for other
purposes, county and police-rates, &amp;c., was, in 1853,
6,854,000<i>l.</i>, and in 1867 10,905,000<i>l.</i>, showing an
increase of 4,000,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; This total expenditure was
distributable under two heads.&nbsp; The amount expended in
actual relief to the poor was, in 1853, 4,939,000<i>l.</i>, as
against 6,959,000<i>l.</i> in 1867, being an increase of
2,020,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; The amount expended, on the other hand,
for other purposes, county- and police-rates, &amp;c., was, in
1853, 1,915,000<i>l.</i>, against 3,945,000<i>l.</i> in 1867.</p>
<p>And now comes the vexed question, Who are the people who,
amongst them, in the metropolis alone, contribute this great sum
of <i>thirteen hundred thousand pounds</i>, and in what
proportion is the heavy responsibility divided?&nbsp; This is the
most unsatisfactory part of the whole business.&nbsp; If, as it
really appears, out of a population of two millions and
three-quarters there must be reckoned a hundred and forty
thousand who from various causes are helpless to maintain
themselves, nothing remains but to maintain them; at the same
time it is only natural that every man should expect to
contribute his fair share, and no more.&nbsp; But this is by no
means the prevailing system.&nbsp; Some pay twopence; others
tenpence, as the saying is.</p>
<p>By an examination of the statistics as to the relative <a
name="page428"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
428</span>contributions of the different unions, we find the
discrepancy so great as to call for early and urgent legislation;
and despite the many and various arguments brought to bear
against amalgamation and equalisation, there is no other mode of
dealing with this great and important question that appears more
just, or more likely to lead to the wished-for result.&nbsp; That
the reader may judge for himself of the magnitude of the
injustice that exists under the present system will not require
much more evidence than the following facts will supply.&nbsp;
The metropolis is divided into five districts, and these again
into unions to the number of six-and-thirty, many of which in
their principal characteristics differ greatly from each
other.&nbsp; We find the West and Central Districts relieve each
between 19,000 and 20,000 poor, the Eastern District about
32,000, and the North District some 27,000; but the Southern
District by far exceeds the rest, as the report states that there
are in receipt of relief no less than 43,000 paupers.&nbsp; These
bare statistics, however, though they may appear at first sight
to affect the question, do not influence it so much as might be
imagined; the weight of the burden is determined by the
proportion that the property on which the poor-rate is levied
bears to the expenditure in the different unions.&nbsp; For
example, St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover-square, contributes about
the same amount (viz. 30,000<i>l.</i>) to the relief of paupers
as St. George&rsquo;s-in-the-East; but take into consideration
the fact that the western union contains a population of about
90,000, and property at the ratable value of <a
name="page429"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 429</span>nearly
1,000,000<i>l.</i>, and the eastern union has less than 50,000
inhabitants, and the estimated value of the property is only
180,000<i>l.</i>; the consequence is that the poor-rate in one
union is upwards of five times heavier than the other, being
8<i>d.</i> in the pound in St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover-square,
and no less than 3<i>s.</i> 5&frac34;<i>d.</i> in St.
George&rsquo;s-in-the-East.&nbsp; The reader may imagine that
this great discrepancy may arise in some degree from the fact
that the two unions mentioned are at the extreme ends of the
metropolis; but even where unions are contiguous to one another
the same contrasts are found.&nbsp; The City of London is
situated between the unions of East London and West London: in
the two latter the rates are not very unequal, being about
2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> in one and 3<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> in the
other; but in the City of London, one of the richest of the
thirty-six unions in the metropolis, the poor-rate is only
7<i>d.</i> in the pound.&nbsp; The cause of this is that, if the
estimates are correct, the City of London Union contains just ten
times the amount of rateable property that the East London does,
the amounts being 1,800,000<i>l.</i> and 180,000<i>l.</i>
respectively.&nbsp; Again, Bethnal Green does not contribute so
much as Islington, and yet its poor-rates are four times as
high.&nbsp; In general, however, we find that in unions
contiguous to one another, the rates do not vary in amount to any
great extent.&nbsp; In the North, for instance, they range from
1<i>s.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, Hampstead being the
exception, and below the shilling.&nbsp; In the South they are
rather higher, being from 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i>
11<i>d.</i>, Lewisham alone being below the shilling.&nbsp; In
the East, as might be expected, the figures are <a
name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 430</span>fearfully
high, all, with one exception, being above 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
and in the majority of cases exceeding 3<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Bethnal
Green, that most afflicted of all unions, is the highest,
reaching the enormous sum of 3<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> in the pound,
being nearly seven times the amount of the rate in the City of
London.&nbsp; In the Central District, which is situated in an
intermediate position, the rates range from 1<i>s.</i>
11<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i>, the City itself being excluded.</p>
<p>No one who reads the foregoing statistics can fail to be
struck with the inequality and mismanagement that they
exhibit.&nbsp; No one can deny that this state of affairs
urgently needs some reorganisation or reform, for who could
defend the present system that makes the poor pay most, and the
rich least, towards the support and maintenance of our poor?</p>
<p>There appears to be a very general impression that the sum
levied for the relief of the poor goes entirely to the relief of
the poor; but there is a great distinction between the sum levied
and the sum actually expended for that purpose.&nbsp; Taking the
average amount of poor-rates levied throughout England and Wales
for the same periods, it is found that for the ten years ending
1860 the average was 7,796,019<i>l.</i>; for the seven years
ending 1867, 9,189,386<i>l.</i>; and for the latest year, 1868,
when a number of other charges were levied nominally under the
same head, 11,054,513<i>l.</i>&nbsp; To gain an idea of the
amount of relief afforded, it was necessary to look to the amount
which had actually been expended.&nbsp; For the ten years ending
1860 the average amount expended for the relief of the poor was
5,476,454<i>l.</i>; for the seven <a name="page431"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 431</span>years ending 1867,
6,353,000<i>l.</i>; and in the latest year,
7,498,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; Therefore the amount actually expended
in the relief of the poor was, in the ten years ending 1860, at
the average annual rate of 5<i>s.</i> 9&frac12;<i>d.</i> per head
upon the population; for the seven years ending 1867, 6<i>s.</i>
1<i>d.</i>; and for the year 1868, 6<i>s.</i>
11&frac12;<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The average number of paupers for the
year ending Lady-day 1849 was 1,088,659, while in 1868 they had
decreased to 992,640.&nbsp; Thus, in 1849 there were 62 paupers
for every 1,000 of the population, and in 1868 there were but 46
for every 1,000, being 16 per 1,000 less in the latter than in
the former year.&nbsp; In 1834, the rate per head which was paid
for the relief of the poor was 9<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>&nbsp; If we
continued in 1868 to pay the same rate which was paid in 1849,
the amount, instead of being 6,960,000<i>l.</i> would be
9,700,000<i>l.</i>, showing a balance of 2,740,000<i>l.</i> in
favour of 1868.</p>
<p>The very heart and core of the poor-law difficulty is to
discriminate between poverty deserving of help, and only
requiring it just to tide over an ugly crisis, and those male and
female pests of every civilised community whose natural
complexion is dirt, whose brow would sweat at the bare idea of
earning their bread, and whose stock-in-trade is rags and
impudence.&nbsp; In his capacity of guardian of the casual ward,
Mr. Bumble is a person who has no belief in decent poverty.&nbsp;
To his way of thinking, poverty in a clean shirt is no more than
a dodge intended to impose on the well-known tenderness of his
disposition.&nbsp; Penury in a tidy cotton gown, to his keen
discernment, is nothing better than <a name="page432"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 432</span>&ldquo;farden pride&rdquo;&mdash;a
weakness he feels it is his bounden duty to snub and correct
whenever he meets with it.&nbsp; It is altogether a mistake to
suppose that all the worthy strivers in the battle for bread, and
who, through misfortune and sickness, sink in the rucks and
furrows of that crowded field, find their way, by a sort of
natural &ldquo;drainage system,&rdquo; to the workhouse.&nbsp;
There are poorer folks than paupers.&nbsp; To be a pauper is at
least to have a coat to wear, none the less warm because it is
made of gray cloth, and to have an undisputed claim on the
butcher and the baker.&nbsp; It is the preservers of their
&ldquo;farden pride,&rdquo; as Bumble stigmatises it, but which
is really bravery and noble patience, who are most familiar with
the scratching at their door of the gaunt wolf <span
class="smcap">Famine</span>; the hopeful unfortunates who are
content to struggle on, though with no more than the tips of
their unlucky noses above the waters of tribulation&mdash;to
struggle and still struggle, though they sink, rather than
acknowledge themselves no better than the repulsive mob of
cadgers by profession Mr. Bumble classes them with.</p>
<p>I have been asked many times since, when, on a memorable
occasion, I volunteered into the ranks of pauperism and assumed
its regimentals, what was the one foremost thought or anxiety
that beset me as I lay in that den of horror.&nbsp; Nothing can
be more simple or honest than my answer to that question.&nbsp;
This was it&mdash;<i>What if it were true</i>?&nbsp; What if,
instead of your every sense revolting from the unaccustomed
dreadfulness you have brought it into contact with, it were your
<a name="page433"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 433</span>lot to
grow used to, and endure it all, until merciful death delivered
you?&nbsp; What if these squalid, unsightly rags, the story of
your being some poor devil of an engraver, who really could not
help being desperately hard-up and shabby, were all
<i>real</i>?&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; Since in all vast
commercial communities there must always exist a proportion of
beggars and paupers, what have I done that I should be
exempt?&nbsp; Am I&mdash;are all of us here so comfortably
circumstanced because we deserve nothing less?&nbsp; What man
dare rise and say so?&nbsp; Why, there are a dozen slippery paths
to the direst ways of Poverty that the smartest among us may
stumble on any day.&nbsp; Again, let us consider who are they who
are most liable to slip.&nbsp; Why, that very class that the
nation is so mightily proud of, and apt at bragging about!&nbsp;
The working man, with his honest horny hand and his broad
shoulders, who earns his daily bread by the sweat of his
brow!&nbsp; We never tire of expressing our admiration for the
noble fellow.&nbsp; There is something so manly, so admirable in
an individual standing up, single-handed and cheerful-hearted,
and exclaiming, in the face of the whole world, &ldquo;With these
two hands, and by the aid of the strength it has pleased God to
bless me with, my wife and my youngsters and myself eat, drink,
and are clothed, and no man can call me his debtor!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He is a fellow to admire; we can afford to admire him, and we
do&mdash;for just so long as he can maintain his independence and
stand without help.&nbsp; But should misfortune in any of its
hundred unexpected shapes assail him, should he fall <a
name="page434"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 434</span>sick or
work fail him, and he be unable to keep out the wolf that
presently eats up his few household goods, rendering him
homeless, <i>then</i> we turn him and his little family over to
the tender mercies of Mr. Bumble, who includes him in the last
batch of impostors and skulkers that have been delivered to his
keeping.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say that, as matters are managed at
present, we can well avoid doing so; but that does not mitigate
the poor fellow&rsquo;s hardship.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that we are gradually emerging from our
bemuddlement; but time was, and that at no very remote period,
when to be poor and houseless and hungry were accounted worse
sins against society than begging or stealing, even&mdash;that is
to say, if we may judge from the method of treatment in each case
pursued; for while the ruffian who lay wait for you in the dark,
and well-nigh strangled you for the sake of as much money as you
might chance to have in your pocket, or the brute who
precipitated his wife from a third-floor window, claimed and was
entitled to calm judicial investigation into the measure of his
iniquity and its deserving, the poor fellow who became a casual
pauper out of sheer misfortune and hard necessity was without a
voice or a single friend.&nbsp; The pig-headed Jack-in-office,
whom the ratepayers employed and had confidence in, had no mercy
for him.&nbsp; They never considered that it was <i>because</i>
he preferred to stave off the pangs of hunger by means of a crust
off a parish loaf rather than dine on stolen roast beef, that he
came knocking at the workhouse-gate, craving shelter and a <a
name="page435"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 435</span>mouthful of
bread!&nbsp; But <i>one</i> idea pervaded the otherwise empty
region that Bumble&rsquo;s cocked-hat covered, and that was, that
the man who would beg a parish loaf was more mean and
contemptible than the one who, with a proper and independent
spirit, as well as a respect for the parochial purse, stole one;
and he treated his victim accordingly.</p>
<p>Vagrancy has been pronounced by the law to be a crime.&nbsp;
Even if regarded in its mildest and least mischievous aspect, it
can be nothing less than obtaining money under false
pretences.&nbsp; It is solely by false pretences and false
representations that the roving tramp obtains sustenance from the
charitable.&nbsp; We have it on the authority of the chief
constable of Westmoreland, that ninety-nine out of every hundred
professional mendicants are likewise professional thieves, and
practise either trade as occasion serves.&nbsp; The same
authority attributes to men of this character the greater number
of burglaries, highway robberies, and petty larcenies, that take
place; and gives it as his opinion, that if the present system of
permitting professional tramps to wander about the country was
done away with, a great deal of crime would be prevented, and an
immense good conferred on the community.</p>
<p>There can be no question that it is, as a member of parliament
recently expressed it, &ldquo;the large charitable heart of the
country&rdquo; that is responsible in great part for the enormous
amount of misapplied alms.&nbsp; People, in giving, recognised
the fact that many of those whom they relieved were impostors and
utterly <a name="page436"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
436</span>unworthy of their charity; but they felt that if they
refused to give, some fellow-creature, in consequence of their
refusal, might suffer seriously from the privations of hunger and
want of shelter.&nbsp; As long as they felt that their refusal
might possibly be attended with these results, so long would they
open their hand with the same readiness that they now did.&nbsp;
The only remedy for this is, that every destitute person in the
country should find food and shelter forthcoming immediately on
application.&nbsp; Vagrancy, says the authority here quoted, is
partly the result of old habits and old times, when the only
question the tramp was asked was, &ldquo;Where do you belong
to?&rdquo;&nbsp; Instead of that being the first question, it
should be the last.&nbsp; The first question should be,
&ldquo;Are you in want, and how do you prove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1858 the number of vagrants was 2416; in 1859, 2153; in
1860, 1941; in 1861, 2830; in 1862, 4234; in 1863, 3158; in 1864,
3339; in 1865, 4450; in 1866, 5017; in 1867, 6129; and in 1868,
7946.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt, however, that a vast number of tramps
circulate throughout the country, of whom we have no
returns.&nbsp; &ldquo;Various means,&rdquo; says the writer above
alluded to, &ldquo;have been tried to check them, but in
vain.&nbsp; If I venture to recommend any remedy, it must be,
that repression, if applied, must be systematic and
general.&nbsp; It is not of the slightest use putting this
repression in force in one part of the country while the
remainder is under a different system.&nbsp; The whole country
must be under <a name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
437</span>the same general system, tending to the same general
result.&nbsp; In the first place, let all the inmates of the
casual wards be placed under the care of the police.&nbsp; Let
them be visited by the police morning and night.&nbsp; Let lists
be made out and circulated through the country; and in no case,
except upon a ticket given by the police, let any relief be given
more than once; and unless a man is able to satisfy the police
that his errand was good, and that he was in search of work, let
him be sent back summarily without relief.&nbsp; It is the habit
of all this class to make a regular route, and they received
relief at every casual ward, thus laying the whole country under
contribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True as this argument may be in the main, we cannot take
kindly to the idea, that every unfortunate homeless wretch who
applies at night to the casual ward for a crust and shelter shall
be treated as a professional tramp until he prove himself a
worthy object for relief.</p>
<p>It is not a little remarkable, that, however legislators may
disagree as to the general utility of the Poor-law under its
present aspect, they are unanimous in approving of the
&ldquo;labour test;&rdquo; whereas, according to the
opportunities I have had of observing its working, it is, to my
thinking, one of the faultiest wheels in the whole machine.&nbsp;
The great error chiefly consists in the power it confers on each
workhouse-master to impose on the tested such work, both as
regards quantity and quality, as he may see fit.&nbsp; I have
witnessed instances in which the &ldquo;labour test,&rdquo;
instead of proving a man&rsquo;s <a name="page438"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 438</span>willingness to work for what he
receives, rather takes the form of a barbarous tyranny, seemingly
calculated as nothing else than as a test of a poor
fellow&rsquo;s control of his temper.&nbsp; Where is the use of
testing a man&rsquo;s willingness to work, if he is compelled in
the process to exhaust his strength and waste his time to an
extent that leaves him no other course but to seek for his hunger
and weariness to-night the same remedy as he had recourse to last
night?&nbsp; They manage these things better in certain parts of
the country and in model metropolitan parishes, but in others the
&ldquo;test&rdquo; system is a mere &ldquo;farce.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
found it so at Lambeth in 1866; and when again I made a tour of
inspection, two years afterwards, precisely the same process was
enforced.&nbsp; This was it.&nbsp; At night, when a man applied
for admittance to the casual ward, he received the regulation
dole of bread, and then went to bed as early as half-past eight
or nine.&nbsp; He was called up at seven in the morning, and
before eight received a bit more bread and a drop of gruel.&nbsp;
This was the &ldquo;breakfast&rdquo; with which he was fortified
previous to his displaying his prowess as a willing labourer.</p>
<p>The chief of the work done by the &ldquo;casual&rdquo; at the
workhouse in question is &ldquo;crank-work.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
crank is a sort of gigantic hand-mill for grinding corn.&nbsp; A
series of &ldquo;cranks&rdquo; or revolving bars extend across
the labour-shed in a double or triple row, although by some means
the result of the joint labour of the full number of operatives,
forty or fifty in number, is concentrated at that point where the
power is required.&nbsp; Let us see <a name="page439"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 439</span>how &ldquo;crank-work&rdquo; of this
sort is applicable as a test of a man&rsquo;s willingness and
industry.</p>
<p>It may be safely taken that of the, say, forty-five
&ldquo;casuals&rdquo; assembled, two-thirds, or thirty, will
belong to that class that is, without doubt, the very worst in
the world&mdash;the hulking villanous sort, too lazy to work and
too cowardly to take openly to the trade of thieving, and who
make an easy compromise between the two states, enacting the
parts of savage bully or whining cadger, as opportunity
serves.&nbsp; Thirty of these, and fifteen real unfortunates who
are driven to seek this shabby shelter only by dire
necessity.&nbsp; In the first place, we have to consider that the
out-and-out vagrant is a well-nurtured man, and possesses the
full average of physical strength; whereas the poor half-starved
wretch, whose poverty is to be pitied, is weak through long
fasting and privation.&nbsp; But no selection is made.&nbsp; Here
is an extended crank-handle, at which six willing men may by
diligent application perform so much work within a given
time.&nbsp; It must be understood that the said work is
calculated on the known physical ability of the able-bodied as
well as the willing-minded man; and it is in this that the great
injustice consists.&nbsp; Let us take a single crank.&nbsp; It is
in charge of six men, and, by their joint efforts, a sack of
corn, say, may be ground in an hour.&nbsp; But joint effort is
quite out of the question.&nbsp; Even while the taskmaster is
present the vagrants of the gang at the crank&mdash;four out of
six, be it remembered&mdash;will make but the merest pretence of
grasping the bar and turning it with energy; they <a
name="page440"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 440</span>will just
close their hands about it, and increase the labour of the
willing minority by compelling them to lift their lazy arms as
well as the bar.&nbsp; But as soon as the taskmaster has
departed, even a pretence of work ceases.&nbsp; The vagrants
simply stroll away from the work and amuse themselves.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the work has to be done; the sack of corn must be
ground before the overnight batch of casuals will be allowed to
depart.&nbsp; But the vagrants are in no hurry; the casual ward
serves them as a sort of handy club-room in which to while away
the early hours of tiresome morning, and to discuss with each
other the most interesting topics of the day.&nbsp; It is their
desire, especially if it should happen to be a wet, cold, or
otherwise miserable morning, to &ldquo;spin-out&rdquo; the time
as long as possible; and this they well know may best be done by
leaving the weak few to struggle through the work apportioned to
the many; and they are not of the sort to be balked when they are
bent in such a direction.</p>
<p>The result is, as may be frequently observed, that the
labour-shed is not cleared until nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, by which time the honest and really industrious
minority have proved their worthiness of relief to an extent that
leaves them scarcely a leg to stand on.&nbsp; They have been
working downright hard since eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The slice
of bread and the drop of gruel they received in the morning is
exhausted within them; their shaky and enfeebled limbs are
a-tremble with the unaccustomed labour; and, it being eleven
o&rsquo;clock in the day, it is altogether too late to <a
name="page441"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 441</span>hope to
pick-up a job, and nothing remains for a poor fellow but to
saunter idly the day through, bemoaning the desperate penalty he
is compelled to pay for a mouthful of parish bread and the
privilege of reposing in an uncomfortable hovel, till night comes
again, and once more he is found waiting at the casual gate.</p>
<p>It may be said that no one desires this, that it is well
understood by all concerned that a workhouse is a place intended
for the relief of the really helpless and unable, and not for the
sustenance of imposture and vagrancy; but that under the present
system it is impossible to avoid such instances of injustice as
that just quoted.&nbsp; This, however, is not the case.&nbsp; It
has been shown in numerous cases that it is possible to economise
pauper-labour so that it shall be fairly distributed, and at the
same time return some sort of profit.</p>
<p>It appears that in Liverpool and Manchester corn-grinding by
<i>hand-mills</i> is chiefly used, as a task for vagrants or
able-bodied in-door poor.&nbsp; In the absence of other more
suitable employment, there is no reason why they should not be so
employed.&nbsp; As, however, but one person can be employed at
the same time on one mill, and the cost of each mill, including
fixing, may be roughly stated at from 3<i>l.</i> to 4<i>l.</i>,
it is clear that no very large number of persons is likely to be
thus employed in any one yard.&nbsp; Despite this and other minor
objections, however, it appears that corn-grinding is as good a
labour-test as you can have in workhouses.&nbsp; It is not
remunerative; it is a work that is disliked; it is <a
name="page442"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 442</span>really
hard; and being one by which there is no actual loss by
accumulation of unsaleable stock, it has much to commend
it.&nbsp; At the establishments in question a fairly strong
able-bodied man is required to grind 120 lbs. of corn daily, and
this is sufficient to occupy him the whole day.&nbsp; The male
vagrants at Liverpool are required to grind 30 lbs. of corn each
at night, and 30 lbs. the following morning.&nbsp; At Manchester
the task for male vagrants is 45 lbs. each, of which one half is
required to be ground at night, and the remainder the next
morning.&nbsp; At the Liverpool workhouse they have 36 of these
mills; at Manchester, 40 at the new or suburban workhouse for
able-bodied inmates, and 35 at the house of industry adjoining
the old workhouse.&nbsp; The mills at the latter are chiefly used
for vagrants, but upon these able-bodied men in receipt of
out-door relief are also occasionally employed.&nbsp; The
ordinary task-work for these last is, however, either farm-labour
at the new workhouse, or oakum-picking at the house of industry,
according to the nature of their former pursuits.&nbsp; During
the cotton famine there was also a large stone-yard, expressly
hired and fitted-up for this class.&nbsp; Another large building
was set apart during that period for the employment of adult
females in receipt of relief in sewing and knitting, and in
cutting-out and making-up clothing; a stock of materials being
provided by the guardians, and an experienced female
superintendent of labour placed in charge of the
establishment.</p>
<p>The experiment of selecting a limited number of <a
name="page443"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 443</span>men from
the stone-yard, and setting them to work in scavenging the
streets, has now been tried for rather more than six months by
the vestry of St. Luke&rsquo;s, City-road, with a fair amount of
success; the men (fifteen from the stone-yard, and ten from the
workhouse) were entirely withdrawn from the relief-lists, and
employed by the vestry at the same rate of wages as the
contractor who previously did the work was in the habit of
paying.&nbsp; Of these men, according to the latest report,
fourteen are still thus employed, and four have obtained other
employment.&nbsp; The remaining seven were discharged&mdash;three
as physically incapable, and four for insubordination.&nbsp; The
conduct of the majority under strict supervision is said to have
been fairly good, though not first-rate; and it is undoubtedly
something gained to have obtained useful work from fourteen out
of twenty-five, and to have afforded four more an opportunity of
maintaining themselves by other independent labour.</p>
<p>At the same time it is clear that such a course is open to two
objections: first, it must have a tendency to displace
independent labour; and secondly, if these paupers are (as in St.
Luke&rsquo;s) at once employed for wages, it would, unless
guarded by making them pass through a long probationary period of
task-work, tend to encourage poor persons out of employ to throw
themselves on the rates, in order thus to obtain remunerative
employment.&nbsp; The better course would seem to be, where
arrangements can be made by the local authorities, for the local
Board to provide only the requisite implements and
superintendence, and for the guardians <a
name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span>in the
first instance to give the labour of the men to the parish,
paying them the ordinary relief for such work as task-work.&nbsp;
If this were done&mdash;and care taken to put them on as extra
hands only, to sweep the pavements, or such other work as is not
ordinarily undertaken by the contractors&mdash;there can be no
doubt that an outlet might be thus afforded for some of the
better-conducted paupers, after a period of real probationary
task-work, to show themselves fit for independent employment, and
so to extricate themselves from the pauper ranks.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It would undoubtedly conduce much to the
utility of these labour-yards if the guardians comprising the
labour or out-door relief committee would, as they now do in some
unions, frequently visit the yard, and thus by personal
observation make themselves acquainted with the conduct and
characters of the paupers, with the nature of the superintendence
bestowed upon them, and with the manner in which the work is
performed.&nbsp; A channel of communication may thus be formed
between employers of labour when in want of hands and those
unemployed workmen who may by sheer necessity have been driven to
apply for and accept relief in this unpalatable form.&nbsp; The
guardians themselves, frequently large employers of labour, are
for the most part well acquainted with those who are compelled to
apply for parish work; and when they see a steady and willing
worker in the yard will naturally inquire into his
antecedents.&nbsp; Where the result of these inquiries is
satisfactory, they will, it may be expected, <a
name="page445"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 445</span>gladly
avail themselves of the earliest opportunity of obtaining for
such a one employment in his previous occupation, or in any other
which may appear to be suited to his capacity.&nbsp; The personal
influence and supervision of individual guardians can scarcely be
overrated; and thus a bond of sympathy will gradually arise
between the guardians and the deserving poor, which, coupled with
the enforcement of real work, will, it may be hoped, prove not
without an ultimate good effect upon even those hardened idlers
who have been hitherto too often found in these yards the
ringleaders in every species of disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above-quoted is the suggestion of the Chairman of the
Poor-law Board, and well indeed would it be, for humanity&rsquo;s
sake, that it should be regarded.&nbsp; As matters are at present
arranged, the labour-system is simply disgusting.&nbsp; Take
Paddington stone-yard, for instance.&nbsp; Unless it is altered
since last year, the peculiar method of doing business there
adopted is this: a man gets an order for stone-breaking, the pay
for which is, say, eighteenpence a &ldquo;yard.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
most workhouses, when a man is put to this kind of labour he is
paid by the bushel: and that is quite fair, because a poor fellow
unused to stone-breaking usually makes a sad mess of it.&nbsp; He
takes hammer in hand, and sets a lump of granite before him with
the idea of smashing it into fragments; but this requires
&ldquo;knack,&rdquo; that is to be acquired only by
experience.&nbsp; The blows he deals the stone will not crack it,
and all that he succeeds in doing for the first hour or two is to
chip <a name="page446"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
446</span>away the corners of one lump after another,
accumulating perhaps a hatful of chips and dust.&nbsp; By the end
of the day, however, he may have managed to break four bushels,
and this at eighteenpence a &ldquo;yard&rdquo; would be valued at
sixpence, and he would be paid accordingly.</p>
<p>But not at Paddington.&nbsp; I had some talk with the worthy
yard-master of that establishment, and he enlightened me as to
their way of doing business there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bushels!&nbsp;
No; we don&rsquo;t deal in bushels here,&rdquo; was his
contemptuous reply to a question I put to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t waste my time in measuring up haporths of stuff all
day long.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s half a yard or none here, and no
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean, that unless a man engages to break at
least half a yard, you will not employ him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to say, whether he engages or not, that
he&rsquo;s got to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose that he fails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he don&rsquo;t get paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t get paid for the half-yard, you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t get paid at all.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
never measure for less than a half-yard, and so he can&rsquo;t be
paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what becomes of the few bushels of stone he has
been able to break?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, he sells &rsquo;em to the others for what
they&rsquo;ll give for &rsquo;em, to put along with theirs.&nbsp;
A halfpenny or a penny&mdash;anything.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s glad to
take it; it&rsquo;s that or none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you have many come here who can&rsquo;t break
half a yard of granite in a day?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page447"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
447</span>&ldquo;Lots of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But they don&rsquo;t
come again; one taste of Paddington is enough for
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What does the reader think of the &ldquo;labour-test&rdquo; in
this case?</p>
<p>An institution has, it appears, been established by the
Birmingham guardians since the autumn of 1867, for the employment
of able-bodied women in oakum-picking for out-door relief, the
result of which has been, that not only has the workhouse been
relieved of a large number of troublesome inmates of this class,
with whom it was previously crowded, but the applications for
relief have diminished in a proportionate ratio.&nbsp; Every
effort is made to induce the women thus employed to seek for more
profitable employment, and the applications at the establishment
for female labour are said to be numerous.&nbsp; The
superintendent, who was formerly matron at the Birmingham
workhouse, reports to Mr. Corbett, that &ldquo;from the opening
of the establishment about fifteen months ago, nineteen have been
hired as domestic servants, ten have obtained engagements in
other situations, and two have married.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition
to these, some forty have obtained temporary employment, of whom
three only have returned to work for relief at the end of the
year.&nbsp; The total estimated saving on orders issued for work,
as compared with the maintenance of the women as inmates of the
workhouse, during the year ending 29th September last, is
calculated to have been 646<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>&nbsp;
Indeed, so satisfactory has been the working of the system during
the first year of its existence, that the <a
name="page448"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 448</span>guardians
have resolved to apply the same test to the male applicants for
relief, and a neighbouring house has been engaged and fitted-up
for putting a similar plan in operation with respect to
men.&nbsp; The total number of orders issued during the first
twelve months after this establishment for female labour was
opened was 719; of which, however, only 456 were used, the other
applicants either not being in want of the relief asked for, or
having found work elsewhere.&nbsp; Each woman is required to pick
3 lbs. of oakum per diem, for which she receives 9<i>d.</i>, or
4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week; and if she has one or more
children, she is allowed at the rate of 3<i>d.</i> a-day
additional relief for each child.&nbsp; The highest number paid
for during any week has been 95 women and 25 children.&nbsp; Some
days during the summer there has been but one at work, and in the
last week of December last there were but eleven.&nbsp; The house
is said to be &ldquo;virtually cleared of a most troublesome
class of inmates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guardians of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, have,
it appears, adopted a system embracing that pursued both at
Manchester and Birmingham, and have provided accommodation for
employing able-bodied women out of the workhouse both in
oakum-picking and needlework; and, say the committee, &ldquo;a
similar course will probably be found advantageous in other
metropolitan parishes or unions, whenever the number of this
class who are applicants for relief exceeds the accommodation or
the means of employment which can be found for them within the <a
name="page449"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
449</span>workhouse.&nbsp; At the same time we would especially
urge that provision should be made in every workhouse for a
better classification of the able-bodied women, and for the
steady and useful employment of this class of inmates.&nbsp;
Those who are not employed in the laundry and washhouse, or in
scrubbing, bed-making, or other domestic work, should be placed
under the superintendence of a firm and judicious task-mistress,
and engaged in mending, making, and cutting-out all the linen and
clothing required for the workhouse and infirmary; and much work
might be done in this way for the new asylums about to be built
under the provisions of the Metropolitan Poor Act.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This plan of a large needle-room presided over by an efficient
officer has been found most successful in its results at the new
workhouse of the Manchester guardians, as well in improving the
character of the young women who remain any time in the house,
and fitting them for home duties after they leave, as in
deterring incorrigible profligates from resorting to the
workhouse, as they were in the habit of doing.&nbsp; Many now
come into our metropolitan workhouses who can neither knit nor
sew nor darn a stocking.&nbsp; This they can at least be taught
to do; and we gather from the experience of Manchester, that
while at first to the idle and dissolute the enforced silence and
order of the needle-room is far more irksome than the comparative
license and desultory work of the ordinary oakum-room, those who
of necessity remain in the house are found by degrees to acquire
habits of order and neatness, and thus become better fitted for
domestic duties.&nbsp; <a name="page450"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 450</span>The following scale of relief for
able-bodied paupers, relieved out of the workhouse and set to
work pursuant to the provisions of the Out-door Relief Regulation
Order, is recommended for adoption by the various Boards of
Guardians represented at a recent conference held under the
presidency of Mr. Corbett:</p>
<p>For a man with wife and one child, 6<i>d.</i> and 4 lbs. of
bread per day; for a man with wife and two children, 7<i>d.</i>
and 4 lbs. of bread per day; for a man with wife and three
children, 7<i>d.</i> and 6 lbs. of bread per day; for a man with
wife and four children, 8<i>d.</i> and 6 lbs. of bread per day;
for a man with wife and five children, 9<i>d.</i> and 6 lbs. of
bread per day; single man, 4<i>d.</i> and 2 lbs. of bread per
day; single women or widows, 4<i>d.</i> and 2 lbs. of bread per
day, with an additional 3<i>d.</i> per day for each child;
widowers with families to be relieved as if with wife living.</p>
<p>Where a widow with one or more young children dependent on her
and incapable of contributing to his, her, or their livelihood,
can be properly relieved out of the workhouse, that she be
ordinarily allowed relief at the rate of 1<i>s.</i> and one loaf
for each child; the relief that may be requisite for the mother
beyond this to be determined according to the special exigency of
the case.&nbsp; That widows without children should, as a rule,
after a period not exceeding three months from the commencement
of their widowhood, be relieved only in the workhouse.&nbsp;
Where the husband of any woman is beyond the seas, or in custody
of the law, or in confinement in an asylum or licensed house as a
lunatic or <a name="page451"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
451</span>idiot, such woman should be dealt with as a widow; but
where a woman has been recently deserted by her husband, and
there are grounds for supposing he has gone to seek for work,
although out-door relief may be ordered for two or three weeks,
to give him time to communicate with his family, yet, after such
reasonable time has elapsed, the wife and family should, as a
rule, be taken into the workhouse, and proceedings taken against
the husband.&nbsp; That the weekly relief to an aged or infirm
man or woman be from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 3<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> weekly, partly in money and partly in kind, according
to his or her necessity; that the weekly relief to aged and
infirm couples be 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>, in money or in kind,
according to their necessities; that when thought advisable,
relief in money only may be given to those of the out-door poor
who are seventy years of age and upwards.</p>
<p>It appears from a recent statement that the guardians of
Eversham union applied not long since for the sanction of the
Poor-law Board to a scheme for boarding-out the orphan children
of the workhouse with cottagers at 3<i>s.</i> a-week, and
10<i>s.</i> a-quarter for clothing; the children to be sent
regularly to school, and to attend divine worship on Sundays;
with the provision that after ten years of age the children may
be employed in labour approved by the guardians, and the wages
divided between the guardians and the person who lodges and
clothes them, in addition to the above payments.&nbsp; In a
letter dated the 3d April 1869, the Secretary of the Poor-law
Board <a name="page452"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
452</span>states that, provided they could be satisfied that a
thorough system of efficient supervision and control would be
established by the guardians, and the most rigid inquiry
instituted at short intervals into the treatment and education of
the children, the Board have come to the conclusion that they
ought not to discourage the guardians from giving the plan a fair
trial, though they cannot be insensible to the fact that a grave
responsibility is thereby incurred.&nbsp; The Secretary mentions
particulars regarding which especial care should be taken, such
as the health of the children to be placed out, the condition of
the persons to whom they are intrusted, and the necessary
periodical inspection.&nbsp; The Board will watch the experiment
with the greatest interest, but with some anxiety.&nbsp; They
request the guardians to communicate to them very fully the
detailed arrangements they are determined to make.&nbsp; The
Board cannot approve the proposed arrangement as to wages.&nbsp;
The guardians have no authority to place out children to serve in
any capacity and continue them as paupers.&nbsp; If they are
competent to render service, they come within the description of
able-bodied persons, and out-door relief would not be
lawful.&nbsp; Upon entering into service, they would cease to be
paupers, and would have the protection of the provisions of the
Act of 1851 relating to young persons hired from a workhouse as
servants, or bound out as pauper apprentices.&nbsp; The
hiring-out of adults by the guardians is expressly prohibited by
56 George III., <i>c.</i> 129.</p>
<p><a name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 453</span>The
great principle of the Poor-law is to make people do anything
rather than go into the workhouse, and the effect is to cause
people to sell their furniture before they will submit to the
degradation; for degradation it is to an honest hardworking man,
and no distinction is made.&nbsp; The effect of the Poor-law has
been to drive men away from the country to the large towns, and
from one large town to another, till eventually they find their
way up to London, and we are now face to face with the large army
of vagabonds and vagrants thus created.&nbsp; A man, once
compelled to break-up his house, once driven from the locality to
which he was attached, and where his family had lived perhaps for
centuries, became of necessity a vagrant, and but one short step
was needed to make him a thief.</p>
<p>It would be a grand step in the right direction, if a means
could be safely adopted that would save a man driven to pauperism
from breaking-up his home.&nbsp; The experiment has, it appears,
been successfully adopted in Manchester, and may prove generally
practicable.&nbsp; The guardians in that city have provided rooms
in which the furniture or other household goods of persons
compelled to seek a temporary refuge in the house may be
stored.&nbsp; It would not do, of course, to enable people to
treat the workhouse as a kind of hotel, to which they might
retire without inconvenience, and where they might live upon the
ratepayers until a pressure was passed.&nbsp; Perhaps the
confinement and the separation of family-ties which the workhouse
involves would sufficiently <a name="page454"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 454</span>prevent the privilege being abused;
but even if such a convenience would need some limitation in
ordinary times, it might be readily granted on an occasion of
exceptional pressure, and it would then produce the greatest
advantages both to the poor and to the ratepayers.&nbsp; The
worst consequence of the workhouse test is, that if a poor man
under momentary pressure is forced to accept it and break-up his
home, it is almost impossible for him to recover himself.&nbsp;
The household goods of a poor man may not be much, but they are a
great deal to him; once gone, he can rarely replace them, and the
sacrifice frequently breaks both his own and his wife&rsquo;s
spirit.&nbsp; If the danger of thus making a man a chronic pauper
were avoided, the guardians might offer the test with much less
hesitation; relief might be far more stringently, and at the same
time more effectually, administered.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE BEST REMEDY.</span></h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Emigration</i>&mdash;<i>The various
Fields</i>&mdash;<i>Distinguish the industrious Worker in need of
temporary Relief</i>&mdash;<i>Last Words</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> other remedies considered, we
come back to that which is cheapest, most lasting, and in every
way the best&mdash;emigration.&nbsp; This, of course, as applying
to unwilling and undeserved pauperism.&nbsp; These are the
sufferers that our colonies are waiting to receive with open
arms.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t want tramps and vagrants.&nbsp; They
won&rsquo;t have them, well knowing the plague such vermin would
be in a land whose fatness runs to waste.&nbsp; But what they are
willing to receive, gladly and hospitably, are men and women,
healthy, and of a mind to work honestly for a liberal wage.&nbsp;
New Zealand has room for ten thousand such; so has Australia and
Canada.</p>
<p>It would be a happy alteration, if some milder term than
&ldquo;pauper&rdquo; might be invented to distinguish the
industrious worker, temporarily distressed, so as to be compelled
to avail himself of a little parochial assistance, from the
confirmed and habitual recipient of the workhouse dole.&nbsp; As
was pertinently remarked by <a name="page456"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 456</span>Colonel Maude, at a recent meeting
held in the rooms of the Society of Arts, and at which the policy
of assisting willing workers to emigrate to New Zealand was
argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are people who are fond of putting
forward the offensive doctrine, that a man who is a
&lsquo;pauper,&rsquo; as they call him, has thereby become unfit
ever again to exercise the self-reliance and independence in any
other country necessary to procure him a living, the want of
which qualities has brought him to the abject condition he is now
in.&nbsp; Like most sweeping generalities, this is both false and
cruel.&nbsp; The condition of the wage-paid class is, in the
nature of things, more dependent than that of any other; and
without for a moment depreciating the wisdom of frugality and
thrift, I would ask some of those who are in the enjoyment of
independent incomes, whether their position would not be almost
as desperate if their income were suddenly withdrawn?&nbsp; And
this is constantly happening to large masses of our artisans, in
many cases entirely without fault of their own; and then how does
the State deal with them?&nbsp; It says, &lsquo;If you will wait
until you have parted with your last penny and your last article
of furniture, and then come to us, we will assist you, but only
then, and only in the following manner: The allowance of food,
clothing, and shelter which we will give you shall be the least
which experience proves will keep body and soul together.&nbsp;
We will break the law of God and of nature by separating you from
your family.&nbsp; We will prevent you seeking <a
name="page457"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 457</span>for work
elsewhere by confining you in a house where employers are not
likely to search for you, and whence you cannot go to seek it
yourself.&nbsp; The nature of the work you shall perform shall
not be that in which you are proficient, but shall be of the most
uninteresting and useless kind.&nbsp; Owing to the small quantity
of food we give you, you will not be able to exert your powers to
their best advantage.&nbsp; By resorting to us for assistance,
you will be lowered in the estimation of your fellow-workmen; and
in all probability, as experience tells us, you will return to us
again and again, until you become a confirmed and helpless
pauper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are fond of pointing to Paris, and of showing how
dearly the French pay for their system of providing work for the
people; but if it be true, as I have lately heard, that there are
one million of paupers at this moment in England&mdash;and
besides these, I am in a position to state that there cannot be
less than one million persons who would be glad of permanent
employment at reasonable wages&mdash;I do not think we have much
to boast of.&nbsp; Besides, does anyone doubt that if the French
Emperor were possessed of our illimitable colonies, with their
endless varieties of climate, he would very soon transfer his
surplus population to them, and be very glad of the chance?&nbsp;
And we ought to consider the cost of our paupers.&nbsp; Let us
take it at 10<i>l.</i> a head per annum.&nbsp; As a matter of
economy, it would pay very well to capitalise this tax, and at
two years&rsquo; purchase we could deport large numbers in great
comfort, and thus save a good deal of money to the ratepayers, <a
name="page458"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 458</span>even
supposing none of the money were ever refunded; but I hope to
show how that amount would be more than repaid.&nbsp; But I
suppose that some people will say, &lsquo;Your system, then, is
transportation?&rsquo;&nbsp; My answer might be, &lsquo;If you
are not ashamed to impose the humiliating and unpleasant
condition which you at present force upon an applicant for
relief, surely when you have satisfied yourselves that his lot
will be much happier and brighter in the new home which you offer
him, all your compunctions should vanish.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have ventured to quote Colonel Maude at length, because he
is a man thoroughly conversant with the subject he treats of, and
all that he asserts may be implicitly relied on.&nbsp; And still
once again I am tempted to let another speak for me what perhaps
I should speak for myself&mdash;the concluding words of this my
last chapter.&nbsp; My justification is, that all that the writer
expresses is emphatically also my opinion; and I am quite
conscious of my inability to convey it in terms at once so
graphic and forcible.&nbsp; The gentleman to whom I am indebted
is the writer of a leader in the <i>Times</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here is a mass of unwilling pauperism,
stranded, so to speak, by a receding tide of prosperity on the
barren shores of this metropolis.&nbsp; Something must be done
with it.&nbsp; The other object is more important, but not so
pressing.&nbsp; It is, that people who cannot get on well at
home, and who find all their difficulties amounting only to
this&mdash;that they have not elbow-room, and that the ground is
too thickly <a name="page459"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
459</span>occupied&mdash;should be directed and even educated to
follow the instructions of Providence, and go to where there is
room for them.&nbsp; There is no reason why every child in this
kingdom should not have the arguments for and against emigration
put before it in good time, before it arrives at the age when
choice is likely to be precipitated, and change of mind rendered
difficult.&nbsp; Children in these days are taught many things,
and there really seems no reason why they should not be taught
something about the colonies, in which five millions of the
British race are now prospering, increasing, and multiplying, not
to speak of the United States.&nbsp; But we must return to the
object more immediately pressing.&nbsp; It is surrounded by
difficulties, as was confessed at the Mansion House, and as is
evident on the facts of the case.&nbsp; But we believe it to be a
case for combined operation.&nbsp; Everything seems to be
ready&mdash;the good men who will take the trouble, the agency,
the willing guardians, the public departments, or, at least,
their functionaries&mdash;and the colonics will not complain if
we send them men willing to work, even though they may have to
learn new trades.&nbsp; The Boards of Guardians and the
Government will contribute, as they have contributed.&nbsp; But
they cannot, in sound principle, do more.&nbsp; The public must
come forward.&nbsp; Sorry as we are to say the word, there is no
help for it.&nbsp; This is not a local, it is a national
affair.&nbsp; Chance has thrown these poor people where they
are.&nbsp; It would be a good opportunity thrown away, if this
work were not done out of hand, one may say.&nbsp; Here are some
thousands <a name="page460"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
460</span>attracted to the metropolis by its specious promises of
a long and solid prosperity.&nbsp; They cannot go back.&nbsp;
They must now be passed on.&nbsp; Where else to but to the
colonies?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be evident by this time to the poor people
themselves that they may wait and wait for years and years
without getting the employment that suits them best.&nbsp; The
metropolitan ratepayers are losing temper, and making themselves
heard.&nbsp; The colonies are all calling for more men and more
women, and more children approaching the age of work.&nbsp;
Several members of the Government attended the meeting, either in
person or by letter, with promises of money, advice, and
aid.&nbsp; There is the encouragement of successful millions, who
within our own lifetime have established themselves all over the
world.&nbsp; Every cause that operated forty years ago operates
now with tenfold force.&nbsp; At that date the only notion of an
emigrant was a rough, misanthropical sort of man, who had read
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and who fancied a struggle for existence
in some remote corner, with a patch of land, some small cattle,
constant hardships, occasional disasters and discoveries, welcome
or otherwise.&nbsp; It was not doubted for a moment that arts and
sciences and accomplishments must be left behind.&nbsp; There
could be no Muses or Graces in that nether world.&nbsp; The lady,
so devoted as to share her husband&rsquo;s fortune in that
self-exile, would have to cook, bake, brew, wash, sew, mend, and
darn, if indeed she could spare time from the still more
necessary toil of getting something eatable out of the <a
name="page461"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 461</span>earth, the
river, or the sea.&nbsp; That was the prevailing picture of
emigrant life; and when missionary tracts and Mr. Burford&rsquo;s
dioramas indicated houses, streets, and public buildings, it was
still surmised that these were flattering anticipations of what
there was to be, just as one may see rows of semi-detached
villas, picturesque drives, shrubberies, miniature lakes, and
gothic churches in the window of a land-agent&rsquo;s office,
representing the golden futurity of a site now covered by cattle
or corn.&nbsp; Forty years have passed, and where there might be
then a few hard settlers, there are now cities, towns, and
villages which England might be proud of; railways, and every
possible application of art and science on a scale often
exceeding our own.&nbsp; Large congregations meet in handsome
churches, stocks and shares are bought and sold, machinery
rattles and whizzes, ladies walk through show-rooms full of the
last Parisian fashions, dinners are given worthy of our clubs,
and operas are performed in a style worthy of Covent Garden, in
places where, forty, years ago, men were eating each
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PALL MALL GAZETTE.&mdash;&ldquo;Of the many works on Billiards
submitted to our notice lately, that written by Mr. <span
class="smcap">Roberts</span> is the best . . .&nbsp; We do not
doubt that every one practising for a month, with the diagrams by
his side, would make more progress than he could boast in a year
with the aid of any other book that we are acquainted
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LAND AND WATER.&mdash;&ldquo;By a series of twenty admirably
coloured plates, all the most likely strokes are demonstrated . .
.&nbsp; Well printed and unique of its kind, and deserving of a
place in every young man&rsquo;s library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SPORTING LIFE.&mdash;&ldquo;On the whole the book may be
described as the most generally interesting on the games we have
seen.&nbsp; The part of it that is original is well written, and
the extracts are well selected and amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE SPORTSMAN.&mdash;&ldquo;The Champion must be commended for
having produced what will become a standard work, and as it is
moderate in price, it will doubtless meet with a large
sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.&mdash;&ldquo;He is best in the second
part of the volume, which gives valuable hints on play.&nbsp;
These hints have accompanying diagrams, the execution of which
leaves nothing to be desired . . .&nbsp; We must give Mr. <span
class="smcap">Roberts</span> credit for using great brevity,
plainness, and clearness of speech.&nbsp; What he professes to
teach he knows thoroughly, and can put into the fewest
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THE FIELD.&mdash;&ldquo;The qualification which contributes
most to Mr. <span class="smcap">Roberts&rsquo;s</span> success is
the judgment by which he is enabled to calculate
consequences&mdash;to select the most favourable stroke when
several are open to him, and to play it with such knowledge of
strength and angles as to leave an easy stroke to follow.&nbsp;
It is this acquired judgment only that any work on Billiards can
teach, and to this Mr. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span> wisely
confines his instructions. . . .&nbsp; The plates are well
executed in colours, and the positions are clearly
defined.&rdquo;</p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
